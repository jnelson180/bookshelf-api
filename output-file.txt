  <description>&lt;b&gt;The book that inspired Marie Kondo's &lt;i&gt;The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up&lt;/i&gt;, Nagisa Tatsumi's international bestseller offers a practical plan to figure out what to keep and what to discard so you can get--and stay--tidy, once and for all.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Practical and inspiring, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Discarding&lt;/em&gt; (the book that originally inspired a young Marie Kondo to start cleaning up her closets) offers hands-on advice and easy-to-follow guidelines to help readers learn how to finally let go of stuff that is holding them back--as well as sage advice on acquiring less in the first place. Author Nagisa Tatsumi urges us to reflect on our attitude to possessing things and to have the courage and conviction to get rid of all the stuff we really don't need, offering advice on how to tackle the things that pile up at home and take back control. By learning the art of discarding you will gain space, free yourself from "accumulation syndrome," and find new joy and purpose in your clutter-free life.</description>

  <description>For the first time the Joker's origin is revealed in this tale of insanity and human perseverance. Looking to prove that any man can be pushed past his breaking point and go mad, the Joker attempts to drive Commissioner Gordon insane. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shooting and permanently paralyzing his daughter Barbara (a.k.a. Batgirl), the Joker kidnaps the commissioner and attacks his mind in hopes of breaking the man. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But refusing to give up, Gordon maintains his sanity with the help of Batman in an effort to beset the madman.</description>

  <description>Attention, all you clumsy pandas, lovable puffins, huggable bunnies, and penguins that elicit ooohs and aaahs: The jig is up! We have lived under your furry fists for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There is a cute and present danger lurking out there–in the wild, in the zoos, and sometimes even in our very own homes. Spurred on by the Cute Industrial Complex, these cuddly animals have taken over blockbuster films, inspirational posters, and computer desktops everywhere, further weakening the innocent civilians who are beguiled by these fuzzy frauds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But you are stronger than them, aren’t you? Those soft bellies and wet noses are no match for you–and their free ride has just come to an end. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;F U, Penguin &lt;/b&gt;is the rallying cry for those who choose to fight these power-hungry cute-mongers. Loaded with color photographs and hilarious commentary, this book will have you laughing out loud while it simultaneously saves you from the tragic fate of tossing yarn with big-eyed kittens and bottle-nursing baby pandas forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ___________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "Finally, a book for the rest of us! Most animals go about our business without playing to the audience like the elitists exposed in these chapters.I wasn't sure how many more times I could hear about those great penguins and pandas and kittens before I started eating people... well, more people, anyway."—Jerry the Shark&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "Penguins killed my parents, and they would not hesitate to kill me. I thank the Crustacean God for Matthew Gasteier, a true saint and a decent human being in a world filled with heartless penguin accomplices."—Dennis the Krill&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "It's all true. We're the worst."—Anonymous Penguin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "The average dolphin is far beyond this level of vulgarity, but I could see how this would be a very enjoyable book for humans. I should remember to hand these out to some of my slower relatives at the common ancestor reunion."—Edward the Dolphin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately, this style of book is not something we are currently looking for. However, we wish you the best of luck with your human publishers!"—Danielle the Bear, Editor-in-Chief, Random Cave Publishing</description>

  <description>Since her first appearance in 1991, Harley Quinn--eccentric female sidekick to the Joker--has captured the attention of readers like few new characters have in eight decades of Batman comics. Her bubbly yet malicious persona has earned her a loyal and growing fan base as she has crossed over into television, theater, video games and film. In this collection of new essays, contributors explore her various iterations, focusing on her origin and contexts, the implications of her abusive relationship with the Joker, her relationships with other characters, her representations across media, and the philosophic basis of her character.</description>

  <description>Fumio Sasaki is not an enlightened minimalism expert; he’s just a regular guy who was stressed at work, insecure, and constantly comparing himself to others—until one day he decided to change his life by reducing his possessions to the bare minimum. The benefits were instantaneous and absolutely remarkable: without all his “stuff,” Sasaki finally felt true freedom, peace of mind, and appreciation for the present moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Goodbye, Things&lt;/i&gt; explores why we measure our worth by the things we own and how the new minimalist movement will not only transform your space but truly enrich your life. Along the way, Sasaki modestly shares his personal minimalist experience, offering tips on the minimizing process and revealing the profound ways he has changed since he got rid of everything he didn’t need. The benefits of a minimalist life can be realized by anyone, and Sasaki’s humble vision of true happiness will open your eyes to minimalism’s potential.</description>

  <description>Boasting 16 of William Shakespeare's most popular and enduring plays, this brand new collection features more Shakespeare Stories than ever before. From the tragedy of Macbeth to the humour of Much Ado About Nothing, this superb collection of paperbacks makes an excellent introduction to Shakespeare for younger readers. The tales have been retold using accessible language and with the help of Tony Ross's engaging black-and-white illustrations, each play is vividly brought to life allowing these culturally enriching stories to be shared with as wide an audience as possible.</description>

  <description>In the near future, the federal government creates a committee to rid society of books it deems unsuitable. The libraries vow to protect their collections, and with the help of local governments, form a military group to defend themselves--the Library Forces! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Library Forces have decided that a censored author, Toma, must defect. But as he and the LF attempt to leave the courthouse, the roads are blocked by Media Betterment Committee troops! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Library Forces member Iku Kasahara and her sergeant (and secret crush) Dojo make off in another direction with Toma. But when Dojo is injured in the escape attempt, Iku is charged with protecting both the endangered author and the man she loves!</description>

  <description>Christopher John Francis Boone knows all the countries of the world and their capitals and every prime number up to 7,057. He relates well to animals but has no understanding of human emotions. He cannot stand to be touched. And he detests the color yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although gifted with a superbly logical brain, for fifteen-year-old Christopher everyday interactions and admonishments have little meaning. He lives on patterns, rules, and a diagram kept in his pocket. Then one day, a neighbor's dog, Wellington, is killed and his carefully constructive universe is threatened. Christopher sets out to solve the murder in the style of his favourite (logical) detective, Sherlock Holmes. What follows makes for a novel that is funny, poignant and fascinating in its portrayal of a person whose curse and blessing are a mind that perceives the world entirely literally.</description>

  <description>“Red Roses” part two! Poison Ivy’s back in town, and she’d like to patch up the friendship with Harley that she damaged in the Bahamas…but sadly for poor Mr. Tool, Ivy’s got some strong opinions on his courtship of Harley! And in “Harley Loves Joker” part six, Harley’s sure she’s got a foolproof plan to get back in Mistah J’s good graces, but when have Harley’s plans ever ended up the way she imagined?</description>

  <description>“Red Roses” part one! Red Tool is done waiting for Harley to take him seriously—the poor sap’s hopelessly in love with her, and it’s time he made his move! Unfortunately, he’s picked a moment of peak distraction for Harley! And in the backup, “Harley Loves Joker” part five, Harley crosses paths with an old pal—Jenna Duffy, the crook known as the Carpenter! There won’t be much palling around, though…Jenna’s convinced Harley’s trying to scam her out of one of the biggest scores of her career!</description>

  <description>Carrie Singleton is just about done with Clover Ridge, Connecticut until she's offered a job as the head of programs and events at the spooky local library, complete with its own librarian ghost. Her first major event is a program presented by a retired homicide detective, Al Buckley, who claims he knows who murdered Laura Foster, a much-loved part-time library aide who was bludgeoned to death fifteen years earlier. As he invites members of the audience to share stories about Laura, he suddenly keels over and dies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The medical examiner reveals that poison is what did him in and Carrie feels responsible for having surged forward with the program despite pushback from her director. Driven by guilt, Carrie's determined to discover who murdered the detective, convinced it's the same man who killed Laura all those years ago. Luckily for Carrie, she has a friendly, knowledgeable ghost by her side. But as she questions the shadows surrounding Laura's case, disturbing secrets come to light and with each step Carrie takes, she gets closer to ending up like Al. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it's due or die for Carrie in Death Overdue, the delightful first in a new cozy series by Allison Brook.</description>

  <description>Charlotte may have left the Floating City, but she’s not out of danger yet. On the run from the British Empire’s clutches, she leads her group of exiles west and south, plunging into a wild world of shady merchants and surly rivermen on the way to New Orleans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the more Charlotte learns about the revolution she has championed, the more questions she has. As she and her friends get to know the hidden tunnels that run below New Orleans, home to criminals, assassins, and pirates, and head deep into the mystical bayou surrounding the city, Charlotte must make a decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do the revolution’s goals justify their means, or are some things too sacred to sacrifice?</description>

  <description>Dimple Shah has it all figured out. With graduation behind her, she’s more than ready for a break from her family, from Mamma’s inexplicable obsession with her finding the “Ideal Indian Husband.” Ugh. Dimple knows they must respect her principles on some level, though. If they truly believed she needed a husband right now, they wouldn’t have paid for her to attend a summer program for aspiring web developers…right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rishi Patel is a hopeless romantic. So when his parents tell him that his future wife will be attending the same summer program as him—wherein he’ll have to woo her—he’s totally on board. Because as silly as it sounds to most people in his life, Rishi wants to be arranged, believes in the power of tradition, stability, and being a part of something much bigger than himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shahs and Patels didn’t mean to start turning the wheels on this “suggested arrangement” so early in their children’s lives, but when they noticed them both gravitate toward the same summer program, they figured, Why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dimple and Rishi may think they have each other figured out. But when opposites clash, love works hard to prove itself in the most unexpected ways.</description>

  <description>Sallot Leon is a thief, and a good one at that. But gender fluid Sal wants nothing more than to escape the drudgery of life as a highway robber and get closer to the upper-class and the nobles who destroyed their home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Sal Leon steals a poster announcing open auditions for the Left Hand, a powerful collection of the Queen's personal assassins named for the rings she wears -- Ruby, Emerald, Amethyst, and Opal -- their world changes. They know it's a chance for a new life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except the audition is a fight to the death filled with clever circus acrobats, lethal apothecaries, and vicious ex-soldiers. A childhood as a common criminal hardly prepared Sal for the trials. But Sal must survive to put their real reason for auditioning into play: revenge.</description>

  <description>He has no voice, or name, only a rank, Eighth. He doesn’t know the details of the mission, only the directives that hum in his mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dart the humans. Leave them where they fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His job is to protect his Offside. Let her do the shooting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until a human kills her…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen year-old Raven is at summer camp when the terrifying armored Nahx invade, annihilating entire cities, taking control of the Earth. Isolated in the wilderness, Raven and her friends have only a fragment of instruction from the human resistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shelter in place.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which seems like good advice at first. Stay put. Await rescue. Raven doesn’t like feeling helpless but what choice does she have?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a Nahx kills her boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrown together in a violent, unfamiliar world, Eighth and Raven should feel only hate and fear. But when Raven is injured, and Eighth deserts his unit, their survival depends on trusting each other…</description>

  <description>After the grisly murder of his entire family, a toddler wanders into a graveyard where the ghosts and other supernatural residents agree to raise him as one of their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody Owens, known to his friends as Bod, is a normal boy. He would be completely normal if he didn't live in a sprawling graveyard, being raised and educated by ghosts, with a solitary guardian who belongs to neither the world of the living nor of the dead. There are dangers and adventures in the graveyard for a boy. But if Bod leaves the graveyard, then he will come under attack from the man Jack—who has already killed Bod's family... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beloved master storyteller Neil Gaiman returns with a luminous new novel for the audience that embraced his New York Times bestselling modern classic Coraline. Magical, terrifying, and filled with breathtaking adventures, The Graveyard Book is sure to enthrall readers of all ages.</description>

  <description>When Lily Sanderson decided to remain Crown Princess Waterlily of the mermaid kingdom Thalassinia, she knew she couldn’t just coast along in the current. But since she’s spent the last couple of years on land—with gorgeous human Quince by her side—Lily’s not sure she has the fins to lead a kingdom. Even her maddeningly pretentious cousin Dosinia seems to know more about ruling than she does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Lily has to dive in deep to keep her promise to Tellin, her mer bond in name only, whose kingdom is suffering in the changing ocean climate. Lily knows this is a seven seas–sized problem: from sea animals dying to oil spills and threats to humans. They’ll need to create some serious waves to make the mer community aware and get it to join together to make things right. Even if that means facing one of the iciest queens in the mer kingdoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when Lily thinks her double life on land and sea can’t get any more complicated, an ancient mer law might separate Lily and Quince after all. It feels as if the pair is up against a solid tsunami wave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this third installment in the series that began with Forgive My Fins and Fins Are Forever, Lily will have to find a way to balance safety and justice for the mer people as well as for the humans she loves.</description>

  <description>On Lily Sanderson’s eighteenth birthday she’ll become just a girl—still a mergirl, true, but signing the renunciation will ink Princess Waterlily of Thalassinia out of existence. That leaves plain old Lily living on land, dating the boy she loves, and trying to master this being-human thing once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that Lily and Quince are together, mer bond or not, she’s almost content to give up her place in the royal succession of Thalassinia. But just when she thinks she has everything figured out, the waves start to get rough. Lily’s father sends a certain whirlpool-stirring cousin to stay with her on land. What did Doe do to get herself exiled from Thalassinia and stuck in terraped form, when everyone knows how much she hates humans? And why why why is she batting her eyelashes at Lily’s former crush, Brody?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seafoam on the raging surf comes when a merboy from Lily’s past shows up—Tellin asks Lily for something that clouds her view of the horizon. There’s a future with Quince on land, her loyalty to the kingdom in the sea, and Lily tossing on the waves in the middle. Will she find a way to reconcile her love, her duty, and her own dreams?</description>

  <description>From the acclaimed and popular illustrator of the New York Times bestseller Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and Snow White, comes a unique and visually stunning spin on Cinderella - published to coincide with the release of the major-motion picture from Walt Disney directed by Kenneth Branagh and featuring an all-star cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles Perrault’s story of a sweet-tempered young girl, forced into servitude by her evil stepmother and stepsisters, who finds true love with a handsome prince (with the help of a fairy godmother), has enchanted readers for more than 300 years. In this lavishly illustrated retelling of the classic fairytale, Camille Rose Garcia reimagines Cinderella through her distinctive visual aesthetic. Hers is a Cinderella for the twenty-first century: Dark, compelling, vibrant, and enthralling.</description>

  <description>A rollicking debut novel from award-winning playwright and screenwriter John Pielmeier reimagines the childhood of the much maligned Captain Hook: his quest for buried treasure, his friendship with Peter Pan, and the story behind the swashbuckling world of Neverland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long defamed as a vicious pirate, Captain James Cook (a.k.a Hook) was in fact a dazzling wordsmith who left behind a vibrant, wildly entertaining, and entirely truthful memoir. His chronicle offers a counter narrative to the works of J.M. Barrie, a “dour Scotsman” whose spurious accounts got it all wrong. Now, award-winning playwright John Pielmeier is proud to present this crucial historic artifact in its entirety for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cook’s story begins in London, where he lives with his widowed mother. At thirteen, he runs away from home, but is kidnapped and pressed into naval service as an unlikely cabin boy. Soon he discovers a treasure map that leads to a mysterious archipelago called the “Never-Isles” from which there appears to be no escape. In the course of his adventures he meets the pirates Smee and Starkey, falls in love with the enchanting Tiger Lily, adopts an oddly affectionate crocodile, and befriends a charming boy named Peter—who teaches him to fly. He battles monsters, fights in mutinies, swims with mermaids, and eventually learns both the sad and terrible tale of his mother’s life and the true story of his father’s disappearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Gregory Maguire’s &lt;i&gt;Wicked, Hook’s Tale &lt;/i&gt;offers a radical new version of a classic story, bringing readers into a much richer, darker, and enchanting version of Neverland than ever before. The characters that our hero meets—including the terrible Doctor Uriah Slinque and a little girl named Wendy—lead him to the most difficult decision of his life: whether to submit to the temptation of eternal youth, or to embrace the responsibilities of maturity and the inevitability of his own mortality. His choice, like his story, is not what you might expect.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;With over 19 million reads on Wattpad, In 27 Days is a Watty-Award recipient, has achieved a #1 ranking in the Adventure category, and has won the hearts of millions of teens around the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From award-winning Wattpad sensation Alison Gervais (@HonorInTheRain) comes a story of redemption, first love, and the strength it takes to change the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hadley Jamison is shocked when she hears that her classmate, Archer Morales, has committed suicide. She didn't know the quiet, reserved guy very well, but that doesn't stop her from feeling there was something she could have done to help him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoping to find some sense of closure, Hadley attends Archer's funeral. There, Hadley is approached by a man who calls himself Death and offers her a deal. If Hadley accepts, she will be sent back 27 days in time to prevent Archer from killing himself. But when Hadley agrees to Death's terms and goes back to right the past, she quickly learns her mission is harder than she ever could have known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hadley soon discovers Archer's reasons for being alone, and Archer realizes that having someone to confide in isn't as bad as he'd always thought. But when a series of dangerous accidents starts pushing them apart, Hadley must decide whether she is ready to risk everything-including her life-to keep Archer safe.</description>

  <description>Callie Reed makes a long overdue visit to her aunt Melodie, who lives in a fairy-tale cottage in quaint Keepsake Cove, home to a bevy of unique collectible shops on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Just as they're beginning to reconnect, Callie discovers her aunt's body on the floor of her music box shop. Grief-stricken, Callie finds she can't accept Melodie's death being called accidental. How could her strong and healthy aunt take such a fatal fall? And why was she there in the middle of the night?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Callie searches for the truth, signs seem to come from her late aunt through a favorite music box, urging Callie on. Or are they warnings? If Callie isn't careful, she could meet a similar deadly fate amid Melodie's collection.</description>

  &lt;b&gt;here&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town and the crisis of conscience that rocked it, &lt;i&gt;To Kill A Mockingbird&lt;/i&gt; became both an instant bestseller and a critical success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, &lt;i&gt;To Kill A Mockingbird&lt;/i&gt; takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter moves between two worlds: the poor neighborhood where she lives and the fancy suburban prep school she attends. The uneasy balance between these worlds is shattered when Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend Khalil at the hands of a police officer. Khalil was unarmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon afterward, his death is a national headline. Some are calling him a thug, maybe even a drug dealer and a gangbanger. Protesters are taking to the streets in Khalil's name. Some cops and the local drug lord try to intimidate Starr and her family. What everyone wants to know is: what &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; went down that night? And the only person alive who can answer that is Starr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what Starr does or does not say could upend her community. It could also endanger her life.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Remember, it’s only a game…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scarlett Dragna has never left the tiny island where she and her sister, Tella, live with their powerful, and cruel, father. Now Scarlett’s father has arranged a marriage for her, and Scarlett thinks her dreams of seeing Caraval—the faraway, once-a-year performance where the audience participates in the show—are over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this year, Scarlett’s long-dreamt-of invitation finally arrives. With the help of a mysterious sailor, Tella whisks Scarlett away to the show. Only, as soon as they arrive, Tella is kidnapped by Caraval’s mastermind organizer, Legend. It turns out that this season’s Caraval revolves around Tella, and whoever finds her first is the winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scarlett has been told that everything that happens during Caraval is only an elaborate performance. Nevertheless she becomes enmeshed in a game of love, heartbreak, and magic. And whether Caraval is real or not, Scarlett must find Tella before the five nights of the game are over or a dangerous domino effect of consequences will be set off, and her beloved sister will disappear forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Welcome, welcome to Caraval…beware of getting swept too far away.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;There is an alternate cover edition for this ASIN &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35109786-truthwitch" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In a continent on the edge of war, two witches hold its fate in their hands.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Young witches Safiya and Iseult have a habit of finding trouble. After clashing with a powerful Guildmaster and his ruthless Bloodwitch bodyguard, the friends are forced to flee their home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safi must avoid capture at all costs as she's a rare Truthwitch, able to discern truth from lies. Many would kill for her magic, so Safi must keep it hidden - lest she be used in the struggle between empires. And Iseult's true powers are hidden even from herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a chance encounter at Court, Safi meets Prince Merik and makes him a reluctant ally. However, his help may not slow down the Bloodwitch now hot on the girls' heels. All Safi and Iseult want is their freedom, but danger lies ahead. With war coming, treaties breaking and a magical contagion sweeping the land, the friends will have to fight emperors and mercenaries alike. For some will stop at nothing to get their hands on a Truthwitch.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"I would say it's a pleasure to meet thee, Prosperity Oceanus Redding, but truly, I only anticipate the delights of destroying thy happiness."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prosper is the only unexceptional Redding in his old and storied family history — that is, until he discovers the demon living inside him. Turns out Prosper's great-great-great-great-great-something grandfather made — and then broke — a contract with a malefactor, a demon who exchanges fortune for eternal servitude. And, weirdly enough, four-thousand-year-old Alastor isn't exactly the forgiving type. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fiend has reawakened with one purpose — to destroy the family whose success he ensured and who then betrayed him. With only days to break the curse and banish Alastor back to the demon realm, Prosper is playing unwilling host to the fiend, who delights in tormenting him with nasty insults and constant attempts trick him into a contract. Yeah, Prosper will take his future without a side of eternal servitude, thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little does Prosper know, the malefactor's control over his body grows stronger with each passing night, and there's a lot Alastor isn't telling his dim-witted (but admittedly strong-willed) human host. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best-selling author Alexandra Bracken comes a tale of betrayal and revenge, of old hurts passed down from generation to generation. Can you ever fully right a wrong, ever truly escape your history? Or will Prosper and Alastor be doomed to repeat it?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Should you ever go back?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been ten years since Abby Williams left home and scrubbed away all visible evidence of her small town roots. Now working as an environmental lawyer in Chicago, she has a thriving career, a modern apartment, and her pick of meaningless one-night stands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when a new case takes her back home to Barrens, Indiana, the life Abby painstakingly created begins to crack. Tasked with investigating Optimal Plastics, the town's most high-profile company and economic heart, Abby begins to find strange connections to Barrens’ biggest scandal from more than a decade ago involving the popular Kaycee Mitchell and her closest friends—just before Kaycee disappeared for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abby knows the key to solving any case lies in the weak spots, the unanswered questions. But as Abby tries to find out what really happened to Kaycee, she unearths an even more disturbing secret—a ritual called “The Game,” which will threaten the reputations, and lives, of the community and risk exposing a darkness that may consume her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With tantalizing twists, slow-burning suspense, and a remote, rural town of just five claustrophobic miles, Bonfire is a dark exploration of the question: can you ever outrun your past?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The longing of dreams draws the dead, and this city holds many dreams.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a supernatural showdown with a serial killer, Evie O’Neill has outed herself as a Diviner. With her uncanny ability to read people’s secrets, she’s become a media darling, earning the title “America’s Sweetheart Seer.” Everyone’s in love with the city’s newest It Girl…everyone except the other Diviners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piano-playing Henry DuBois and Chinatown resident Ling Chan are two Diviners struggling to keep their powers a secret—for they can walk in dreams. And while Evie is living the high life, victims of a mysterious sleeping sickness are turning up across New York City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Henry searches for a lost love and Ling strives to succeed in a world that shuns her, a malevolent force infects their dreams. And at the edges of it all lurks a man in a stovepipe hat who has plans that extend farther than anyone can guess…As the sickness spreads, can the Diviners descend into the dreamworld to save the city?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this heart-stopping sequel to &lt;i&gt;The Diviners&lt;/i&gt;, Printz Award-winning and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Libba Bray takes readers deeper into the mystical underbelly of New York City.</description>

  <description>Evie O’Neill has been exiled from her boring old hometown and shipped off to the bustling streets of New York City—and she is pos-i-tute-ly ecstatic. It’s 1926, and New York is filled with speakeasies, Ziegfeld girls, and rakish pickpockets. The only catch is that she has to live with her uncle Will and his unhealthy obsession with the occult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evie worries he’ll discover her darkest secret: a supernatural power that has only brought her trouble so far. But when the police find a murdered girl branded with a cryptic symbol and Will is called to the scene, Evie realizes her gift could help catch a serial killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Evie jumps headlong into a dance with a murderer, other stories unfold in the city that never sleeps. A young man named Memphis is caught between two worlds. A chorus girl named Theta is running from her past. A student named Jericho hides a shocking secret. And unknown to all, something dark and evil has awakened.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Frozen&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Bloody Chamber&lt;/i&gt; in this feminist fantasy reimagining of the Snow White fairytale&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At sixteen, Mina's mother is dead, her magician father is vicious, and her silent heart has never beat with love for anyone—has never beat at all, in fact, but she’d always thought that fact normal. She never guessed that her father cut out her heart and replaced it with one of glass. When she moves to Whitespring Castle and sees its king for the first time, Mina forms a plan: win the king’s heart with her beauty, become queen, and finally know love. The only catch is that she’ll have to become a stepmother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen-year-old Lynet looks just like her late mother, and one day she discovers why: a magician created her out of snow in the dead queen’s image, at her father’s order. But despite being the dead queen made flesh, Lynet would rather be like her fierce and regal stepmother, Mina. She gets her wish when her father makes Lynet queen of the southern territories, displacing Mina. Now Mina is starting to look at Lynet with something like hatred, and Lynet must decide what to do—and who to be—to win back the only mother she’s ever known…or else defeat her once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entwining the stories of both Lynet and Mina in the past and present, &lt;i&gt;Girls Made of Snow and Glass&lt;/i&gt; traces the relationship of two young women doomed to be rivals from the start. Only one can win all, while the other must lose everything—unless both can find a way to reshape themselves and their story.</description>

  <description>Gemma Doyle and Jayne Wilson are busy managing the Sherlock Holmes Bookshop and Emporium on Baker Street and adjoining Mrs. Hudson's Tea Room in anticipation of the store's upcoming book signing with the illustrious Renalta Van Markoff, author of the controversial Hudson and Holmes mystery series. But during the author Q&amp;amp;A session, dedicated Sherlockian Donald Morris verbally attacks Renalta and her series for disgracing Sherlock's legacy, only to be publicly humiliated when the author triumphantly lashes back and gains the upper hand. That is until Renalta collapses on the table--dead. Donald insists he didn't do it and pleads to his friends to clear his name. Fortunately, Gemma and Jayne have no shortage of suspects between author's bullied personal assistant, her frustrated publicist, the hapless publisher, a handsome rare book dealer, an obsessively rabid fan, and a world of other Sherlock enthusiasts with strong objections to Renalta's depiction of the Great Detective. It's up to the shrewd sleuthing duo to eliminate the impossible and deduce the truth before the West London police arrest an innocent man in &lt;i&gt;Body on Baker Street&lt;/i&gt;, the second Sherlock Homes Bookshop mystery perfect for fans of Miranda James and Kate Carlisle.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;#GIRLBOSS&lt;/i&gt; vertelt Sophia Amoruso het verhaal van haar ongelooflijke succes. Ze laat zien hoe iedereen succesvol kan worden, als je op jezelf vertrouwt en je instinct volgt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophia Amoruso is de oprichter en CEO van kledingbedrijf Nasty Gal, een organisatie met een omzet van meer dan 100 miljoen dollar en meer dan 350 mensen in dienst. Maar het eerste wat ze ooit online verkocht was geen kledingstuk – het was een boek dat ze ergens gestolen had. Tot haar tweeëntwintigste had ze allerlei verschillende baantjes en geen enkel idee wat ze wilde doen met haar leven. Toen besloot ze eens te proberen wat vintage kleding te verkopen op eBay. De rest is geschiedenis</description>

  <description>In every spiritual tradition, we find teachings that lead to a fulfilling life-- such as generosity, kindness, honesty, determination, and patience. Today, a growing body of research from neuroscience and social psychology supports these teachings, offering insights into cultivating these virtues in ourselves and our families. Raising Resilience is a practical guide for parents and educators of children from preschool through adolescence, detailing ten universal principles for happy families and thriving children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the follow-up to his acclaimed Growing Up Mindful, Dr. Christopher Willard bridges the latest science with Eastern wisdom to explore ourselves and share with our children. Topics include: cultivating kindness, gratitude, and generosity; simplifying family life; promoting healthy relationships with technology, sex, and drugs; teaching children about privilege; working with perfectionism; utilizing the science of self-compassion; practicing patience and grit; and much more.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>In his prime, Edward Bloom was an extraordinary man. He could outrun anybody. He never missed a day of school. He saved lives and tamed giants. Animals loved him, people loved him, women loved him. He knew more jokes than any man alive. At least that’s what he told his son, William. But now Edward Bloom is dying, and William wants desperately to know the truth about his elusive father—this indefatigable teller of tall tales—before it’s too late. So, using the few facts he knows, William re-creates Edward’s life in a series of legends and myths, through which he begins to understand his father’s great feats, and his great failings. The result is hilarious and wrenching, tender and outrageous.</description>

  <description>An exploration of dreaming history, science, traditions, and practices from prehistory to today&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Examines ancient dream traditions from around the world, shamanic dreaming, and the profound role of dreaming in Native American and African-American cultures&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Investigates dream psychology and the neuroscience of the dreaming brain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Explores the practice of dream incubation, lucid dreaming, and telepathic dreaming with tips on remembering your dreams and working with them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have been dreaming for all of our 3 million or more years of existence. Dreams provide an extraordinary way to process the day’s events and uncover new perspectives. Many cultural creatives credit their world-changing creations to their dreams, and science now believes that dreams helped evolve the very process of thought itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this book, Stephen Larsen and Tom Verner examine dream traditions from around the world, beginning with the oldest records from ancient Egypt, India, Greece, and Australia and expanding to shamanic and indigenous societies. The authors investigate the psychology of dreaming, the neuroscience behind the dreaming brain, the Jungian perspective, and the intersections of yoga and modern dream research. They show how dreams and myth are related in the timeless world of the Archetypal Imagination and how dreams often reveal the wishes of the soul. They explore the practice of dream incubation, an age-old tradition for seeding the unconscious mind to help solve problems and gain deep insights. They examine the profound role that dreams have played in the survival of exploited and persecuted cultures, such as the Native Americans, African slaves, and the Jews during the Holocaust, and share inspirational dream stories from exceptional woman dreamers such as Hildegard von Bingen, Joan of Arc, and Harriet Tubman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing on their more than 50 years’ experience keeping dream journals, the authors offer techniques to help you remember your dreams and begin to work with them. They also explore the clairvoyant and telepathic dimensions of dreaming and the practices of lucid dreaming and shamanic dreaming. Revealing how the alchemical cauldron of dreaming can bring inspiration, healing, and discovery, the authors show how dreams unite us with each other and the past and future dreamers of our world.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;Dad is Fat&lt;/i&gt;, stand-up comedian Jim Gaffigan, who’s best known for his legendary riffs on Hot Pockets, bacon, manatees, and McDonald's, expresses all the joys and horrors of life with five young children—everything from cousins ("celebrities for little kids") to toddlers’ communication skills (“they always sound like they have traveled by horseback for hours to deliver important news”), to the eating habits of four year olds (“there is no difference between a four year old eating a taco and throwing a taco on the floor”). Reminiscent of Bill Cosby’s &lt;i&gt;Fatherhood&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Dad is Fat &lt;/i&gt;is sharply observed, explosively funny, and a cry for help from a man who has realized he and his wife are outnumbered in their own home.</description>

  <description>Discover the skills it takes to become a scientist in DK's new science book for kids with science presenter and comedian &lt;b&gt;Steve Mould&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a scientist isn't just about wearing a lab coat and performing science experiments in test tubes. It's about looking at the world and trying to figure out how it works. As well as simple science experiments for kids to try, &lt;i&gt;How to Be a Scientist&lt;/i&gt; will teach them how to think like a scientist and ask questions including: why doesn't pineapple jelly set, how do you grow your own crystals, and how does a black and white image turn to colour?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For every scientific concept the child learns they will be encouraged to find new ways to test it further. Fun questions, science games, and real-life scenarios make science relevant to children. In &lt;i&gt;How to be a Scientist&lt;/i&gt; the emphasis is on inspiring kids, which means less time spent in stuffy labs and more time in the real world!</description>

  <description>What do you do when you meet a ghost? One: Provide the ghost with some of its favorite snacks, like mud tarts and earwax truffles. Two: Tell your ghost bedtime stories (ghosts love to be read to). Three: Make sure no one mistakes your ghost for whipped cream or a marshmallow when you aren't looking! If you follow these few simple steps and the rest of the essential tips in How to Make Friends with a Ghost, you'll see how a ghost friend will lovingly grow up and grow old with you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A whimsical story about ghost care, Rebecca Green's debut picture book is a perfect combination of offbeat humor, quirky and sweet illustrations, and the timeless theme of friendship.</description>

  <description>During World War II more than one thousand Filipinas were kidnapped by the Imperial Japanese Army. &lt;i&gt;Lolas’ House&lt;/i&gt; tells the stories of sixteen surviving Filipino “comfort women.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; M. Evelina Galang enters into the lives of the women at Lolas’ House, a community center in metro Manila. She accompanies them to the sites of their abduction and protests with them at the gates of the Japanese embassy. Each woman gives her testimony, and even though the women relive their horror at each telling, they offer their stories so that no woman anywhere should suffer wartime rape and torture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lolas’ House&lt;/i&gt; is a book of testimony, but it is also a book of witness, of survival, and of the female body. Intensely personal and globally political, it is the legacy of Lolas’ House to the world.</description>

  <description>In 2006 Larry Smith, the creator of &lt;i&gt;SMITH Magazine&lt;/i&gt;, challenged readers to tell their story in just six words. Modeled after a famous quote by Ernest Hemingway, Smith showed the world that short-form story-telling could be powerful. Since the publication of the first book in his bestselling series, &lt;i&gt;Not Quite What I Was Planning, &lt;/i&gt;people all over the world have shared their stories in print, online, in the classroom, and with their friends and families.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bolstered by the success of the memoir form, Larry Smith is back again with a poignant collection of universal wisdom, life lessons, and caution thrown to the wind that will put a smile on your face six words at a time. With contributions from celebrities like Molly Ringwald, "post-adolescent? Then stop blaming your parents;" Lemony Snicket, "never, ever refuse a breath mint;" and Gary Shteyngart, "hands where I can see 'em," as well as everyday people who've learned a thing or two about a thing or two during their time on the planet, readers will pulled into the sometimes hilarious, often serious, ocassionally reflective experience of the book. Smith's currated advice book is the straight-shooting, truth-telling, next door neighbor everybody wishes they had access to growing up. Now they do! Here's six more life-changing words of advice for you: Read this; you won't regret it.</description>

  <description>Discover 67 shocking-but-true medical misfires that run the gamut from bizarre to deadly. Like when doctors prescribed morphine for crying infants. When snorting skull moss was a cure for a bloody nose. When consuming mail-order tapeworms was a latter-day fad diet. Or when snake oil salesmen peddled strychnine (used in rat poison) as an aphrodisiac in the '60s. Seamlessly combining macabre humor with hard science and compelling storytelling, Quackery is a visually rich and information-packed exploration of history's most outlandish cures, experiments, and scams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A humorous book that delves into some of the wacky but true ways that humans have looked to cure their ills. Leeches, mercury, strychnine, and lobotomies are a few of the topics that explore what lengths society has gone in the search for health.</description>

  <description>Every year, Rich Fischer leaves his family behind to teach a class on cartooning at an annual week-long summer arts conference. Amy O’Donnell is a student in narrative painting, the mother of three, married to a brutish Wall Street titan who runs a multi-billion dollar private equity fund. Rich and Amy met at the conference a year ago, shared a moment of passion, bonding over the shock at how their lives had turned out, then spent the winter exchanging hot texts and emails. Now they’re back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first day of the conference, at the annual softball game, Amy trips on second base and breaks her wrist, and is taken off the field by paramedics. Beside himself with guilt and longing, torn and confused about how to comfort her, Rich wanders into a jewelry store and accidentally buys a bracelet, wiping out his family’s checking account, which is also their savings account, and was supposed to pay for his daughter’s preschool in the fall. He then accompanies Amy through a near-death country-doctoring to complete the most arduous seduction in history. At this point, Rich comes to realize that all anyone needs for wild sex is two people who know each other just well enough to feel safe but don’t share a kitchen. In the delightfully wicked events that follow, these people entirely unravel.&lt;br /&gt;This is an unforgettable tale of love and adultery, set against the landscape of a New England fishing village, with pornographic sunsets and The Sea Breeze Motel. Because of its location, the conference has an easy time attracting poets, skitterish teenagers in search of illicit pleasures, old guys, driftwood sculptors, printmakers, actors, and playwrights. On the faculty are Nobel Prize-winning storytellers, talented performers, biographers, addicts, drunkards and perverts, one hit has-beens, mid-list somebodies, and legitimate stars. There is a kind of heated, inordinate bonding that happens among grown-ups, forced out of their decorous privacy, into visceral closeness, that has the feeling of an open air loony bin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who Is Rich? is a study in midlife alienation, erotic pleasure, envy, and bitterness in the new gilded age. But the novel also addresses deeper questions of family, monogamy and the intoxicating beauty of children within a confusing domestic alliance.</description>

  <description>When thrift-store aficionado Julie discovers a series of antique paintings with hidden glowing images that are only visible in the dark, she wants to learn more about the artist. In her search, she uncovers a century-old romance and the haunting true story of the Radium Girls, young women who used radioactive paint to make the world's first glow-in-the-dark products—and ultimately became radioactive themselves. As Julie’s obsession with the paintings mounts, truths about the Radium Girls—and her own complicated relationships—are revealed. But will she uncover the truth about the luminous paintings before putting herself and everyone she loves at risk?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Falling&lt;/i&gt; presents a warm, wise, and wonderfully vivid novel about a mother who asks her three estranged daughters to come home to help her end her life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ronni Sunshine left London for Hollywood to become a beautiful, charismatic star of the silver screen. But at home, she was a narcissistic, disinterested mother who alienated her three daughters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as possible, tomboy Nell fled her mother's overbearing presence to work on a farm and find her own way in the world as a single mother. The target of her mother s criticism, Meredith never felt good enough, thin enough, pretty enough. Her life took her to London and into the arms of a man whom she may not even love. And Lizzy, the youngest, more like Ronni than any of them, seemed to have it easy, using her drive and ambition to build a culinary career to rival her mother's fame, while her marriage crumbled around her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now the Sunshine Girls are together again, called home by Ronni, who has learned that she has a serious disease and needs her daughters to fulfill her final wishes. And though Nell, Meredith, and Lizzy are all going through crises of their own, their mother s illness draws them together to confront old jealousies and secret fears and they discover that blood might be thicker than water after all.</description>

  <description>In her first novel since winning the Newbery Medal, Katherine Applegate delivers an unforgettable and magical story about family, friendship, and resilience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jackson and his family have fallen on hard times. There's no more money for rent. And not much for food, either. His parents, his little sister, and their dog may have to live in their minivan. Again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crenshaw is a cat. He's large, he's outspoken, and he's imaginary. He has come back into Jackson's life to help him. But is an imaginary friend enough to save this family from losing everything?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beloved author Katherine Applegate proves in unexpected ways that friends matter, whether real or imaginary.</description>

  <description>Learn to read with your own voice and get the answers to all of your questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, Melissa Cynova has been sitting down with friends and neighbors who are curious about the tarot. She's heard all the questions and misconceptions that can confuse newcomers (and sometimes more experienced readers, too). &lt;em&gt;Kitchen Table Tarot &lt;/em&gt;was written as a guide for anyone looking for no-nonsense lessons with a warm, friendly, and knowledgeable teacher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Join Melissa as she shares straightforward guidance on decks, spreads, card meanings, and symbols. Filled with real-life examples and personal explanations of what it's like to read the cards, this book tells it like it is and provides the information you need to read with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;"Cynova's debut book struts forward to lead the pack with its authentic voice, candid and nimble teaching approach, and ability to pare down the principles and experience of reading tarot to its essentials . . . Exemplary. Eminent. Authoritative. A veritable gem." —Benebell Wen, author of &lt;em&gt;Holistic Tarot &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"A punch-in-the-gut teaching guide to the tarot . . . illustrating how much the tarot encourages each of us to find our own unique language and meanings when we begin this journey."—Terry Iacuzzo, author of &lt;em&gt;Small Mediums at Large&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Melissa Cynova has written one of the most accessible, relatable tarot books ever. Pull up a chair, pop a cold one, and get ready for some straight-talking tarot lessons that will have you slinging the cards like a tarot badass in no time at all!"—Theresa Reed, author of &lt;em&gt;The Tarot Coloring Book&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I’ve read many books about tarot readings, but this one is my favorite book so far.”—Library Noire&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This book is a major asset to anyone curious about tarot . . . Reading KITCHEN TABLE TAROT genuinely feels like sitting down with her and getting a whole workshop series delivered one-on-one.”—Amber Unmasked</description>

  <description>A red tide is rising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the daughter of one of the mer-king’s trusted advisors, seventeen-year-old Jade has great responsibilities. When her fiancé murders a naiad, plunging the underwater city of Thessalonike into uproar, tensions surge between the mer and the naiads. Jade learns too late that the choices she makes ripple further than she'd ever imagined. And as she fights against the tide of anger in a city that lives for scandal, she discovers danger lurking in every canal, imperiling her family and shattering the ocean's fragile peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can the city's divisions be mended before the upwelling of hate rips apart everything Jade loves?</description>

  <description>When writer and director Joss Whedon created the character Buffy the Vampire Slayer, he could hardly have expected the resulting academic interest in his work. Yet almost six years after the end of Buffy on television, Buffy studies--and academic work on Whedon's expanding oeuvre--continue to grow. Now with three hugely popular television shows, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly, and the film Serenity all available on DVD, scholars are evaluating countless aspects of the Whedon universe (or "Whedonverse"). Buffy, Ballads, and Bad Guys Who Sing: Music in the Worlds of Joss Whedon studies the significant role that music plays in these works, from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to the internet musical Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog. Kendra Preston Leonard has collected a varying selection of essays that explore music and sound in Joss Whedon's works. The essays investigate both diegetic and non-diegetic music, considering music from various sources, including the shows' original scores, music performed by the characters themselves, and music contributed by such artists as Michelle Branch, The Sex Pistols, and Sarah McLachlan, as well as classical composers like Camille Saint-Saens and Johannes Brahms. The approaches incorporate historical and theoretical musicology, feminist and queer musicology, media studies, cultural history, and interdisciplinary readings. The book also explores the compositions written by Whedon himself: the theme music for Firefly, and two fully integrated musicals, the Buffy episode "Once More, With Feeling" and Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog. With several musical examples, a table with a full breakdown of the Danse Macabre scene from the acclaimed Buffy episode "Hush," and an index, this volume will be fascinating to students and scholars of science-fiction, television, film, and popular culture.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;You Can Count on Animals to Make Yoga Fun!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; What could be more fun for kids than to hop like a frog, slither like a snake, and roar like a lion--all while learning an empowering, healthy life skill? &lt;i&gt;Zoo Zen: A Yoga Story for Kids &lt;/i&gt;is a delightful pose-along adventure for children ages four to eight. Young readers will join our heroine Lyla as she learns ten yoga poses from her friends at the zoo, receiving helpful tips along the way from each animal she encounters. Using rhyming and counting to make memorization easier, here is an imaginative book that combines the benefits of yoga with kids' natural love for animals to create a magical learning journey that parents and kids can enjoy together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Ages 4-8</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;How to Relax&lt;/i&gt; is part of &lt;i&gt;The Mindfulness Essentials&lt;/i&gt; series of how-to titles by Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh, introducing beginners and reminding seasoned practitioners of the essentials of mindfulness practice. Pocket-sized, with original two color illustrations by Jason DeAntonis, How to Relax shows how critical it is to regularly interrupt the hub-bub and routine of our lives to stop, relax mindfully, and recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh says that when we relax, we “become calm water, and we will reflect reality as it is. If we’re not calm, the image we reflect will be distorted. When the image is distorted by our minds, it’s not the reality, and it causes lots of suffering.” With sections on healing, relief from nonstop thinking, transforming unpleasant sounds, solitude, being peace, and more, How to Relax includes meditations you can do to help you achieve the benefits of relaxation no matter where you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a unique gift for those who want a simple guide to achieving deep relaxation, controlling stress, and renewing mental freshness and clarity, appropriate for those practicing in any spiritual tradition, whether seasoned practitioners or new to meditations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With fifteen two color drawings by celebrated artist Jason DeAntonis.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;How to Walk&lt;/i&gt; is the fourth title in Parallax’s popular Mindfulness Essentials Series of how-to titles by Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh, introducing beginners and reminding seasoned practitioners of the essentials of mindfulness practice. Slow, concentrated walking while focusing on in- and out-breaths allows for a unique opportunity to be in the present. There is no need to arrive somewhere—each step is the arrival to concentration, joy, insight, and the momentary enlightenment of aliveness. When your foot touches the Earth with awareness, you make yourself alive and the Earth real, and you forget for one minute the searching, rushing, and longing that rob our daily lives of awareness and cause us to “sleepwalk” through life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thich Nhat Hanh shares amusing stories of the impact mindful walking has on both the walker and those who notice him, and shows how mindful walking can be a technique for diminishing depression, recapturing wonder, and expressing gratitude. Pocket-sized, with original two color illustrations by Jason DeAntonis, &lt;i&gt;How to Walk&lt;/i&gt; is a unique gift for all ages, sharing a simple practice that can have a profound effect on practitioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scientific studies indicate that meditation contributes tremendously to well-being, general health, and longevity. &lt;i&gt;How to Walk&lt;/i&gt; is a unique gift for those who want a comprehensive yet simple guide to understanding the many benefits of walking meditation, along with meditative poems to recite silently while walking. Appropriate for those practicing in any spiritual tradition, &lt;i&gt;How to Walk&lt;/i&gt; will benefit both seasoned practitioners and those new to meditation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>Eating is a chance to return to the present moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to Eat&lt;/i&gt; is the second in Parallax’s series of how-to titles by Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh. These friendly, pocket-sized books contain several delightful illustrations by Jason DeAntonis, and are appropriate for those practicing in any spiritual tradition and all levels of familiarity with mindfulness practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to Eat&lt;/i&gt; clearly and succinctly explains how you can incorporate eating as a form of meditation. The book provides practical advice on how to become truly nourished through the mindful preparation, serving, eating, and cleaning up of food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eating a meal in mindfulness reveals that you are nourished by the whole universe. This awareness helps develop compassion and understanding, reminding practitioners that there are things they can do to help nourish people who are hungry and lonely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to Eat&lt;/i&gt; encourages moderation and taking time to truly savor what we eat. By doing so, you too can become healthier, more fully enjoy what you eat, and help reduce waste.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The third title in Parallax’s &lt;i&gt;Mindfulness Essentials Series&lt;/i&gt; of how-to titles by Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh, &lt;i&gt;How to Love&lt;/i&gt; introduces beginners and reminds seasoned practitioners of the essentials of mindfulness practice. This time Nhat Hanh brings his signature clarity, compassion, and humor to the thorny question of how to love and distills one of our strongest emotions down to four essentials: you can only love another when you feel true love for yourself; love is understanding; understanding brings compassion; and deep listening and loving speech are key ways of showing our love. Featuring original illustrations by Jason DeAntonis, &lt;i&gt;How to Love&lt;/i&gt; shows that when we feel closer to our loved ones, we are also more connected to the world as a whole. With sections on Love vs. Need, Being in Love, Reverence, Intimacy, Children and Family, Reconciling with Parents, and more, &lt;i&gt;How to Love&lt;/i&gt; includes meditations readers can do alone or with a partner to expand their capacity to love. This comprehensive guide to understanding the many different kinds of love also includes meditative practices that expand the understanding of and capacity for love, appropriate for those practicing in any spiritual tradition, whether seasoned practitioners or new to meditation.</description>

With more than fifty imaginative exercises to be practiced alone or with a group, this book unlocks your intuitions and helps you experience the cards from the inside out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as an actor prepares for a new role, you can explore tarot through emotions, memories, role-playing, observation, bodywork, and imagination. This book is the perfect guide for readers who want outside-the-box techniques for relating to the cards from the deepest parts of the soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Includes a foreword by Rachel Pollack, author of&lt;em&gt; The New Tarot Handbook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Come explore the drama in the cards!

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist takes readers on a surprising tour of America’s biggest export, our most prodigious product, and our greatest legacy: our trash.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The average American produces 102 tons of garbage across a lifetime and $50 billion in squandered riches are rolled to the curb each year. But our bins are just the starting point for a strange, impressive, mysterious, and costly journey that may also represent the greatest untapped opportunity of the century. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Garbology&lt;/i&gt;, Edward Humes investigates trash—what’s in it; how much we pay for it; how we manage to create so much of it; and how some families, communities, and even nations are finding a way back from waste to discover a new kind of prosperity. Along the way , he introduces a collection of garbage denizens unlike anyone you’ve ever met: the trash-tracking detectives of MIT, the bulldozer-driving sanitation workers building Los Angeles’ Garbage Mountain landfill, the artists residing in San Francisco’s dump, and the family whose annual trash output fills not a dumpster or a trash can, but a single mason jar.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Garbology&lt;/i&gt; reveals not just what we throw away, but who we are and where our society is headed. Waste is the one environmental and economic harm that ordinary working Americans have the power to change—and prosper in the process.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A new book from #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Jenny Lawson, destined to be a classic—part therapy, part best friend, part humor, part coloring book.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jenny Lawson is anxious, one of the things she does is to draw. Elaborate doodles, beautiful illustrations, often with captions that she posts online. At her signings, fans show up with printouts of these drawings for Jenny to autograph. And inevitably they ask her when will she publish a whole book of them. That moment has arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;You Are Here &lt;/i&gt;is something only Jenny could create. A combination of inspiration, therapy, coloring, humor, and advice, this book is filled with Jenny’s amazingly intricate illustrations, all on perforated pages that can be easily torn out, hung up, and shared. Drawing on the tenets of art therapy—which you can do while hiding in the pillow fort under your bed—&lt;i&gt;You Are Here&lt;/i&gt; is ready to be made entirely your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the material is dark, some is light; some is silly and profane and irreverent. Gathered together, this is life, happening right now, all around, in its messy glory, as only Jenny Lawson could show us.</description>

  <description>We know you shouldn't take your dragon to the library, but what about taking him out to dinner? After all, dragons need to eat too! But with fiery breath, flapping wings, and pointy spikes, that might not be a good idea! Rhyming text and diverse characters bring the importance of dinner manners to a new level in this colorful picture book by Julie Gassman.</description>

  <description>The incredible true story of the women who fought America's Undark danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Curies' newly discovered element of radium makes gleaming headlines across the nation as the fresh face of beauty, and wonder drug of the medical community. From body lotion to tonic water, the popular new element shines bright in the otherwise dark years of the First World War. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, hundreds of girls toil amidst the glowing dust of the radium-dial factories. The glittering chemical covers their bodies from head to toe; they light up the night like industrious fireflies. With such a coveted job, these "shining girls" are the luckiest alive - until they begin to fall mysteriously ill. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the factories that once offered golden opportunities are now ignoring all claims of the gruesome side effects, and the women's cries of corruption. And as the fatal poison of the radium takes hold, the brave shining girls find themselves embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of America's early 20th century, and in a groundbreaking battle for workers' rights that will echo for centuries to come. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written with a sparkling voice and breakneck pace, The Radium Girls fully illuminates the inspiring young women exposed to the "wonder" substance of radium, and their awe-inspiring strength in the face of almost impossible circumstances. Their courage and tenacity led to life-changing regulations, research into nuclear bombing, and ultimately saved hundreds of thousands of lives...</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Anything can happen once upon a con…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When geek girl Elle Wittimer sees a cosplay contest sponsored by the producers of &lt;i&gt;Starfield&lt;/i&gt;, she &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; to enter. First prize is an invitation to the ExcelsiCon Cosplay Ball and a meet-and-greet with the actor slated to play Federation Prince Carmindor in the reboot. Elle’s been scraping together tips from her gig at the Magic Pumpkin food truck behind her stepmother’s back, and winning this contest could be her ticket out once and for all—not to mention a fangirl’s dream come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teen actor Darien Freeman is less than thrilled about this year’s ExcelsiCon. He used to live for conventions, but now they’re nothing but jaw-aching photo sessions and awkward meet-and-greets. Playing Federation Prince Carmindor is all he’s ever wanted, but the diehard &lt;i&gt;Starfield&lt;/i&gt; fandom has already dismissed him as just another heartthrob. As ExcelsiCon draws near, closet nerd Darien feels more and more like a fake—until he meets a girl who shows him otherwise.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;As words and stories are increasingly disseminated through digital means, the significance of the book as object—whether pristine collectible or battered relic—is growing as well. &lt;i&gt;Unpacking My Library: Writers and Their Books&lt;/i&gt; spotlights the personal libraries of thirteen favorite novelists who share their collections with readers. Stunning photographs provide full views of the libraries and close-ups of individual volumes: first editions, worn textbooks, pristine hardcovers, and childhood companions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her introduction, Leah Price muses on the history and future of the bookshelf, asking what books can tell us about their owners and what readers can tell us about their collections. Supplementing the photographs are Price's interviews with each author, which probe the relation of writing to reading, collecting, and arranging books. Each writer provides a list of top ten favorite titles, offering unique personal histories along with suggestions for every bibliophile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Unpacking My Library: Writers and Their Books&lt;/i&gt; features the personal libraries of Alison Bechdel, Stephen Carter, Junot Díaz, Rebecca Goldstein and Steven Pinker, Lev Grossman and Sophie Gee, Jonathan Lethem, Claire Messud and James Wood, Philip Pullman, Gary Shteyngart, and Edmund White.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Straight from the library--the strange and bizarre, ready to be checked out!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a patron's missing wetsuit to the scent of crab cakes wafting through the stacks, &lt;i&gt;I Work at a Public Library&lt;/i&gt; showcases the oddities that have come across Gina Sheridan's circulation desk. Throughout these pages, she catalogs her encounters with local eccentrics as well as the questions that plague her, such as, "What is the standard length of eyebrow hairs?" Whether she's helping someone scan his face onto an online dating site or explaining why the library doesn't have any dragon autobiographies, Sheridan's bizarre tales prove that she's truly seen it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stacked high with hundreds of strange-but-true stories, &lt;i&gt;I Work at a Public Library&lt;/i&gt; celebrates librarians and the unforgettable patrons that roam the stacks every day.</description>

  <description>#1 New York Times bestseller Charlaine Harris returns to her Aurora Teagarden mystery series with a fabulous new book featuring the small-town Southern librarian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the latest installment of the #1 New York Times Bestselling Charlaine Harris’s Aurora Teagarden series, Robin and Aurora have finally begun their adventure in parenting. With newborn Sophie proving to be quite a handful, Roe’s mother pays for a partially trained nurse, Virginia Mitchell, to come help the new parents for a few weeks. Virginia proves to be especially helpful when Robin has to leave town for work and Roe is struck with a bad case of the flu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One particularly stormy night, Roe wakes to hear her daughter crying and Virginia nowhere to be found. Roe's brother Philip helps her search the house and they happen upon a body outside… but it isn’t Virginia’s. Now, not only does she have a newborn to care for and a vulnerable new marriage to nurture, Roe also has to contend with a new puzzle -- who is this mystery woman dead in their backyard, and what happened to Virginia? This heart-pounding and exciting next installment of the Aurora Teagarden series will leave fans happy and hungry for more.</description>

  <description>Now best known for her &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;-bestselling Sookie Stackhouse novels, Charlaine Harris garnered an unusual degree of acclaim with her first novel -- the story of a murder that embroils a small-town reporter in a mystery that hits close to home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catherine Linton came home to Lowfield, Mississippi convinced that the untimely deaths of her parents in a car accident was no accident -- but nobody believed her. So she stayed, taking a job at the local paper, to try to both convince the sheriff that she was right-and maybe convince herself she was wrong. After all, her father had been the town doctor, loved (she always thought) by all. To think he was killed was to think that one of her friends or neighbors has harbored some deep resentment toward him. Then she finds the dead body of the women who had been her father's nurse for many years. Obviously murdered. Now Catherine knows that she was not wrong about her parent's death. Someone in Lowfield has a terrible secret, a secret worth killing for. Not once, not twice, but -- when another body is found -- three times. And the killer won't hesitate to add more victims to the list, as Catherine gets closer and closer to the truth.</description>

      <![CDATA[Hmmm. Okay then.<br /><br />So, this was a short "little" read. For being Charlaine Harris' first work, it isn't bad...but I *did* notice that her bad writing habit of overusing the word "little" which has been a prevalent pet-peeve of mine with all of her works began here. Sigh. Moving on...<br /><br />This was an odd...]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sarah's Scribbles,  Goodreads Choice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; Award for 2016:  Best Graphic Novels &amp;amp; Comics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah Andersen's hugely popular, world-famous &lt;i&gt;Sarah's Scribbles&lt;/i&gt; comics are for those of us who boast bookstore-ready bodies and Netflix-ready hair, who are always down for all-night reading-in-bed parties and extremely exclusive after-hour one-person music festivals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the most recent &lt;i&gt;Sarah's Scribbles&lt;/i&gt; fan favorites and dozens of all-new comics, this volume contains illustrated personal essays on Sarah's real-life experiences with anxiety, career, relationships and other adulthood challenges that will remind readers of Allie Brosh's &lt;i&gt;Hyperbole and a Half&lt;/i&gt; and Jenny Lawson's &lt;i&gt;Let's Pretend This Never Happened&lt;/i&gt;. The same uniquely frank, real, yet humorous and uplifting tone that makes Sarah's Scribbles so relatable blooms beautifully in this new longer form.</description>

  <description>Denmark is often said to be the happiest country in the world. That's down to one thing: hygge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Hygge has been translated as everything from &lt;i&gt;the art of creating intimacy &lt;/i&gt;to &lt;i&gt;cosiness of the soul &lt;/i&gt;to&lt;i&gt; taking pleasure from the presence of soothing things&lt;/i&gt;. My personal favourite is &lt;i&gt;cocoa by candlelight&lt;/i&gt;...'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know hygge when you feel it. It is when you are cuddled up on a sofa with a loved one, or sharing comfort food with your closest friends. It is those crisp blue mornings when the light through your window is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who better than &lt;b&gt;Meik Wiking&lt;/b&gt; to be your guide to all things hygge? Meik is CEO of the Happiness Research Institute in Copenhagen and has spent years studying the magic of Danish life. In this beautiful, inspiring book he will help you be more hygge: from picking the right lighting and planning a dinner party through to creating an emergency hygge kit and even how to dress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meik Wiking&lt;/b&gt; is the CEO of the Happiness Research Institute in Copenhagen. He is committed to finding out what makes people happy and has concluded that hygge is the magic ingredient that makes Danes the happiest nation in the world.</description>

  <description>In a land ruled and shaped by violent magical storms, power lies with those who control them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aurora Pavan comes from one of the oldest Stormling families in existence. Long ago, the ungifted pledged fealty and service to her family in exchange for safe haven, and a kingdom was carved out from the wildlands and sustained by magic capable of repelling the world’s deadliest foes. As the sole heir of Pavan, Aurora’s been groomed to be the perfect queen. She’s intelligent and brave and honorable. But she’s yet to show any trace of the magic she’ll need to protect her people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To keep her secret and save her crown, Aurora’s mother arranges for her to marry a dark and brooding Stormling prince from another kingdom. At first, the prince seems like the perfect solution to all her problems. He’ll guarantee her spot as the next queen and be the champion her people need to remain safe. But the more secrets Aurora uncovers about him, the more a future with him frightens her. When she dons a disguise and sneaks out of the palace one night to spy on him, she stumbles upon a black market dealing in the very thing she lacks—storm magic. And the people selling it? They’re not Stormlings. They’re storm hunters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legend says that her ancestors first gained their magic by facing a storm and stealing part of its essence. And when a handsome young storm hunter reveals he was born without magic, but possesses it now, Aurora realizes there’s a third option for her future besides ruin or marriage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She might not have magic now, but she can steal it if she’s brave enough. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Challenge a tempest. Survive it. And you become its master.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Fast Food Nation&lt;/i&gt; for the foods we grow and depend on&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bananas we eat today aren't your parents' bananas: We eat a recognizable, consistent breakfast fruit that was standardized in the 1960s from dozens into one basic banana. But because of that, the banana we love is dangerously susceptible to a pathogen that might wipe them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's the story of our food today: Modern science has brought us produce in perpetual abundance-once-rare fruits are seemingly never out of season, and we breed and clone the hardiest, best-tasting varieties of the crops we rely on most. As a result, a smaller proportion of people on earth go hungry today than at any other moment in the last thousand years, and the streamlining of our food supply guarantees that the food we buy, from bananas to coffee to wheat, tastes the same every single time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our corporate food system has nearly perfected the process of turning sunlight, water and nutrients into food. But our crops themselves remain susceptible to the nature's fury. And nature always wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Authoritative, urgent, and filled with fascinating heroes and villains from around the world, &lt;i&gt;Never Out of Season&lt;/i&gt; is the story of the crops we depend on most and the scientists racing to preserve the diversity of life, in order to save our food supply, and &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>"Like Henry David Thoreau, but with Wi-Fi." — Boston Globe &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if everything you ever wanted isn't what you actually want? Twenty-something, suit-clad, and upwardly mobile, Joshua Fields Millburn thought he had everything anyone could ever want. Until he didn't anymore. Blindsided by the loss of his mother and his marriage in the same month, Millburn started questioning every aspect of the life he had built for himself. Then, he accidentally discovered a lifestyle known as minimalism...and everything started to change. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was four years ago. Since, Millburn, now 32, has embraced simplicity. In the pursuit of looking for something more substantial than compulsory consumption and the broken American Dream, he jettisoned most of his material possessions, paid off loads of crippling debt, and walked away from his six-figure career. So, when everything was gone, what was left? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a how-to book but a why-to book, Everything That Remains is the touching, surprising story of what happened when one young man decided to let go of everything and begin living more deliberately. Heartrending, uplifting, and deeply personal, this engrossing memoir is peppered with insightful (and often hilarious) interruptions by Ryan Nicodemus, Millburn's best friend of twenty years.</description>

  <description>A literary sensation and runaway bestseller, this brilliant debut novel presents with seamless authenticity and exquisite lyricism the true confessions of one of Japan's most celebrated geisha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Memoirs of a Geisha&lt;/i&gt;, we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love is scorned as illusion. It is a unique and triumphant work of fiction - at once romantic, erotic, suspenseful - and completely unforgettable.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;When Tobi Tobias decided to open her own ad agency, having to moonlight in a pet shop wasn’t part of her vision . . . of course, neither was murder.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Sometimes when opportunity knocks, the door you open leads to a closet. That’s certainly the case for Tobi, whose weekends spent cleaning cages in her best friend’s pet shop may soon be over. She’s just landed her first big break—Zander Closet Company needs a catchy campaign slogan ASAP, and Tobi thinks she’s got the right hook to knock ’em dead: “When we’re done, even your skeletons will have a place.”&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; But when a real dead body topples out of a showcase closet, she’s about to discover there &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;such a thing as bad publicity. To save her fledgling business and not get killed by the competition, Tobi takes on a new pet project: solving the murder. But with a stressed-out parrot as the only witness to the crime, Tobi will really have to wing it to put the cagey killer behind bars.</description>

A key to the fundamentals of early Buddhist philosophy, it has been translated into more languages than any other Buddhist text.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>The Dalai Lama serves as a living symbol of holiness and selfless triumph over tribulation for people of all religious traditions-as well as those with no religious affiliation at all. This collection of daily quotations drawn from His Holiness's own writings, teachings, and interviews offers words of guidance, compassion, and peace that are as down to earth as they are rich in spirit. Suffused with endearing informality, warmth, and practicality, they cover almost every aspect of human life, secular and religious--from loneliness, suffering, anger, and everyday insecurities to happiness, intimacy, and responsibility to others. With a special foreword by His Holiness on the power of meditation and personal responsibility, &lt;i&gt;The Path to Tranquility&lt;/i&gt; is a fresh and accessible spiritual treasure to return to day after day, year after year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>A collection of humorous autobiographical essays by the Academy Award-nominated actress and star of &lt;i&gt;Up in the Air&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pitch Perfect&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even before she made a name for herself on the silver screen starring in films like &lt;i&gt;Pitch Perfect&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Up in the Air&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Twilight&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Into the Woods&lt;/i&gt;, Anna Kendrick was unusually small, weird, and “10 percent defiant.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the ripe age of thirteen, she had already resolved to “keep the crazy inside my head where it belonged. Forever. But here’s the thing about crazy: It. Wants. Out.” In &lt;i&gt;Scrappy Little Nobody&lt;/i&gt;, she invites readers inside her brain, sharing extraordinary and charmingly ordinary stories with candor and winningly wry observations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her razor-sharp wit, Anna recounts the absurdities she’s experienced on her way to and from the heart of pop culture as only she can—from her unusual path to the performing arts (Vanilla Ice and baggy neon pants may have played a role) to her double life as a middle-school student who also starred on Broadway to her initial “dating experiments” (including only liking boys who didn’t like her back) to reviewing a binder full of butt doubles to her struggle to live like an adult woman instead of a perpetual “man-child.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Anna’s world and follow her rise from “scrappy little nobody” to somebody who dazzles on the stage, the screen, and now the page—with an electric, singular voice, at once familiar and surprising, sharp and sweet, funny and serious (well, not that serious).</description>

  <description>Sequel to the extraordinary THE NAME OF THE WIND, THE WISE MAN'S FEAR is the second instalment of this superb fantasy trilogy from Patrick Rothfuss. This is the most exciting fantasy series since George R. R. Martin's A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, and a must-read for all fans of HBO's GAME OF THRONES. Picking up the tale of Kvothe Kingkiller once again, we follow him into exile, into political intrigue, courtship, adventure, love and magic . . . and further along the path that has turned Kvothe, the mightiest magician of his age, a legend in his own time, into Kote, the unassuming pub landlord. Packed with as much magic, adventure and home-grown drama as THE NAME OF THE WIND, this is a sequel in every way the equal to its predecessor and a must-read for all fantasy fans. Readable, engaging and gripping THE WISE MAN'S FEAR is the biggest and the best new fantasy novel out there.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover for this ISBN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28550610-harry-potter-and-the-sorcerer-s-stone" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prepare to be spellbound by Jim Kay's dazzling depiction of the wizarding world and much loved characters in this full-colour illustrated hardback edition of the nation's favourite children's book – &lt;i&gt;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone&lt;/i&gt;. Brimming with rich detail and humour that perfectly complements J.K. Rowling's timeless classic, Jim Kay's glorious illustrations will captivate fans and new readers alike. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a letter arrives for unhappy but ordinary Harry Potter, a decade-old secret is revealed to him that apparently he's the last to know. His parents were wizards, killed by a Dark Lord's curse when Harry was just a baby, and which he somehow survived. Leaving his unsympathetic aunt and uncle for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry stumbles upon a sinister mystery when he finds a three-headed dog guarding a room on the third floor. Then he hears of a missing stone with astonishing powers, which could be valuable, dangerous – or both. An incredible adventure is about to begin!</description>

  <description>Eve has a problem with clutter. Too much stuff and too easily acquired, it confronts her in every corner and on every surface in her house. When she pledges to tackle the worst offender, her horror of a "Hell Room," she anticipates finally being able to throw away all of the unnecessary things she can't bring herself to part with: her fifth-grade report card, dried-up art supplies, an old vinyl raincoat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what Eve discovers isn't just old CDs and outdated clothing, but a fierce desire within herself to hold on to her identity. Our things represent our memories, our history, a million tiny reference points in our lives. If we throw our stuff in the trash, where does that leave us? And if we don't...how do we know what's really important?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has their own Hell Room, and Eve's battle with her clutter, along with her eventual self-clarity, encourages everyone to dig into their past to declutter their future. &lt;i&gt;Year of No Clutter&lt;/i&gt; is a deeply inspiring--and frequently hilarious -- examination of why we keep stuff in the first place, and how to let it all go.</description>

  <description>Told in Kvothe's own voice, this is the tale of the magically gifted young man who grows to be the most notorious wizard his world has ever seen. The intimate narrative of his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, his years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-ridden city, his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a legendary school of magic, and his life as a fugitive after the murder of a king form a gripping coming-of-age story unrivaled in recent literature. A high-action story written with a poet's hand, &lt;i&gt;The Name of the Wind&lt;/i&gt; is a masterpiece that will transport readers into the body and mind of a wizard.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An enchanting modern fable&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The frogs enjoy their life at the pond, filling their days with fly brunches and night music. But one day a little frog finds a crown at the bottom of the pond and is instantly pronounced a queen. She starts doing what queens do: making demands and expecting others to serve her. But when her royal subjects start to question her authority, she must prove she's fit to rule—if she can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Reminiscent of Aesop's fables, this beautifully illustrated book is sure to start a discussion about the concept of leadership and the importance of humility.</description>

  <description>Gemma Doyle, a transplanted Englishwoman, has returned to the quaint town of West London on Cape Cod to manage her Great Uncle Arthur's Sherlock Holmes Bookshop and Emporium. The shop--located at 222 Baker Street--specializes in the Holmes canon and pastiche, and is also the home of Moriarty the cat. When Gemma finds a rare and potentially valuable magazine containing the first Sherlock Homes story hidden in the bookshop, she and her friend Jayne (who runs the adjoining Mrs. Hudson's Tea Room) set off to find the owner, only to stumble upon a dead body. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highly perceptive Gemma is the police’s first suspect, so she puts her consummate powers of deduction to work to clear her name, investigating a handsome rare books expert, the dead woman's suspiciously unmoved son, and a whole family of greedy characters desperate to cash in on their inheritance. But when Gemma and Jayne accidentally place themselves at a second murder scene, it's a race to uncover the truth before the detectives lock them up for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of Sherlock Holmes will delight in the sleuthing duo of Gemma and Jayne in &lt;i&gt;Elementary, She Read&lt;/i&gt;, the clever and captivating series debut by nationally bestselling author Vicki Delany.</description>

  <description>Prentisstown isn't like other towns. Everyone can hear everyone else's thoughts in an overwhelming, never-ending stream of Noise. Just a month away from the birthday that will make him a man, Todd and his dog, Manchee -- whose thoughts Todd can hear too, whether he wants to or not -- stumble upon an area of complete silence. They find that in a town where privacy is impossible, something terrible has been hidden -- a secret so awful that Todd and Manchee must run for their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But how do you escape when your pursuers can hear your every thought?&lt;/b&gt;</description>

  <description>At thirty-nine, Leona Accorsi is broke, single, back in school, and living in her sister Carly’s basement. She’s perfectly content being quirky Auntie Lee to Carly’s four children. That is, until Leona’s doctor tells her that if she wants to have a child, she’d better do it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leona does want a baby. She always has, but the circumstances have never been right. Now she has a huge decision to make: face motherhood on her own or risk missing out on its rewards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, she’s let her romantic life go stagnant. She barely even knows any single men. She has just a few prospects: a Vietnam vet and partial amputee, his intimidating son, the sweet but troubled man who tutors her niece, and a fellow nursing student she’s never actually met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Leona discovers more about each one, she realizes any of them could be the right man for the job. The more important question is, has she become the right woman?</description>

  <description>Ceony Twill arrives at the cottage of Magician Emery Thane with a broken heart. Having graduated at the top of her class from the Tagis Praff School for the Magically Inclined, Ceony is assigned an apprenticeship in paper magic despite her dreams of bespelling metal. And once she’s bonded to paper, that will be her only magic… forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet the spells Ceony learns under the strange yet kind Thane turn out to be more marvelous than she could have ever imagined — animating paper creatures, bringing stories to life via ghostly images, even reading fortunes. But as she discovers these wonders, Ceony also learns of the extraordinary dangers of forbidden magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An Excisioner — a practitioner of dark, flesh magic — invades the cottage and rips Thane’s heart from his chest. To save her teacher’s life, Ceony must face the evil magician and embark on an unbelievable adventure that will take her into the chambers of Thane’s still-beating heart—and reveal the very soul of the man.</description>

  <description>Someone is after Starters like Callie and Michael—teens with chips in their brains. They want to experiment on anyone left over from Prime Destinations—Starters who can be controlled and manipulated. With the body bank destroyed, Callie no longer has to rent herself out to creepy Enders. But Enders can still get inside her mind and make her do things she doesn't want to do. Like hurt someone she loves. Having the chip removed could save her life—but it could also silence the voice in her head that might belong to her father. Callie has flashes of her ex-renter Helena's memories, too . . . and the Old Man is back, filling her with fear. Who is real and who is masquerading in a teen body?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is ever who they appear to be, not even the Old Man. Determined to find out who he really is and grasping at the hope of a normal life for herself and her younger brother, Callie is ready to fight for the truth. Even if it kills her.</description>

  <description>National Book Foundation 5 Under 35 Award winner Charles Yu delivers his debut novel, a razor-sharp, ridiculously funny, and utterly touching story of a son searching for his father . . . through quantum space–time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Minor Universe 31 is a vast story-space on the outskirts of fiction, where paradox fluctuates like the stock market, lonely sexbots beckon failed protagonists, and time travel is serious business. Every day, people get into time machines and try to do the one thing they should never do: change the past. That’s where Charles Yu, time travel technician—part counselor, part gadget repair man—steps in. He helps save people from themselves. Literally. When he’s not taking client calls or consoling his boss, Phil, who could really use an upgrade, Yu visits his mother (stuck in a one-hour cycle of time, she makes dinner over and over and over) and searches for his father, who invented time travel and then vanished. Accompanied by TAMMY, an operating system with low self-esteem, and Ed, a nonexistent but ontologically valid dog, Yu sets out, and back, and beyond, in order to find the one day where he and his father can meet in memory. He learns that the key may be found in a book he got from his future self. It’s called &lt;i&gt;How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe,&lt;/i&gt; and he’s the author. And somewhere inside it is the information that could help him—in fact it may even save his life. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wildly new and adventurous, Yu’s debut is certain to send shock waves of wonder through literary space–time.</description>

  <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;A tribute to the brilliant craftsmanship of one of our most distinguished writers, providing valuable insight into her inspiration and her method&lt;/blockquote&gt; Joyce Carol Oates is widely regarded as one of America's greatest contemporary literary figures. Having written in a number of genres -- prose, poetry, personal and critical essays, as well as plays -- she is an artist ideally suited to answer essential questions about what makes a story striking, a novel come alive, a writer an artist as well as a craftsman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Faith of a Writer, &lt;/em&gt;Oates discusses the subjects most important to the narrative craft, touching on topics such as inspiration, memory, self-criticism, and "the unique power of the unconscious." On a more personal note, she speaks of childhood inspirations, offers advice to young writers, and discusses the wildly varying states of mind of a writer at work. Oates also pays homage to those she calls her "significant predecessors" and discusses the importance of reading in the life of a writer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oates claims, "Inspiration and energy and even genius are rarely enough to make 'art': for prose fiction is also a craft, and craft must be learned, whether by accident or design." In fourteen succinct chapters, &lt;em&gt;The Faith of a Writer&lt;/em&gt; provides valuable lessons on how language, ideas, and experience are assembled to create art.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;HER WORLD IS CHANGED FOREVER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Callie lost her parents when the Spore Wars wiped out everyone between the ages of twenty and sixty. She and her little brother, Tyler, go on the run, living as squatters with their friend Michael and fighting off renegades who would kill them for a cookie. Callie's only hope is Prime Destinations, a disturbing place in Beverly Hills run by a mysterious figure known as the Old Man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He hires teens to rent their bodies to Enders—seniors who want to be young again. Callie, desperate for the money that will keep her, Tyler, and Michael alive, agrees to be a donor. But the neurochip they place in Callie's head malfunctions and she wakes up in the life of her renter, living in her mansion, driving her cars, and going out with a senator's grandson. It feels almost like a fairy tale, until Callie discovers that her renter intends to do more than party—and that Prime Destinations' plans are more evil than Callie could ever have imagined. . . .</description>

  <description>Voyeuristic. Inspirational. Entertaining. One thousand blank journals are currently circulating throughout the world, beckoning contributors who find the journals by chance on trains, in cafés, and anonymously left on doorsteps. Artist Someguy shares more than 250 of the best entries: a collage of African countries repositioned into a new continent; the musings of a teen trapped in a drug- ravaged community; a student's humorous personal ad for his ideal girlfriend ("C-cup required!"). A faux leather cover and two beautifully embroidered pages bring the look and feel of the original journals to life. The perfect gift for journalists, aspiring artists, designers, and anyone who can't wait for one of the journals to magically appear in their lives.</description>

      <![CDATA[I would say helpful overall, but a little too much of the authors own work to illustrate points.

  <description>An unflinching, darkly funny, and deeply moving story of a boy, his seriously ill mother, and an unexpected monstrous visitor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At seven minutes past midnight, thirteen-year-old Conor wakes to find a monster outside his bedroom window. But it isn't the monster Conor's been expecting - he's been expecting the one from his nightmare, the nightmare he's had nearly every night since his mother started her treatments. The monster in his backyard is different. It's ancient. And wild. And it wants something from Conor. Something terrible and dangerous. It wants the truth. From the final idea of award-winning author Siobhan Dowd - whose premature death from cancer prevented her from writing it herself - Patrick Ness has spun a haunting and darkly funny novel of mischief, loss, and monsters both real and imagined.</description>

  <description>This controversial, impassioned call-to-arms for a return to the ideals that fueled the French Resistance has sold millions of copies worldwide since its publication in France in October 2010. Rejecting the dictatorship of world financial markets and defending the social values of modern democracy, 93-old Stephane Hessel -- Resistance leader, concentration camp survivor, and former UN speechwriter -- reminds us that life and liberty must still be fought for, and urges us to reclaim those essential rights we have permitted our governments to erode since the end of World War II."</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An enthralling collection of nonfiction essays on myriad topics—from art and artists to dreams, myths, and memories—observed in Neil Gaiman’s probing, amusing, and distinctive style.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An inquisitive observer, thoughtful commentator, and assiduous craftsman, Neil Gaiman has long been celebrated for the sharp intellect and startling imagination that informs his bestselling fiction. Now, The View from the Cheap Seats brings together for the first time ever more than sixty pieces of his outstanding nonfiction. Analytical yet playful, erudite yet accessible, this cornucopia explores a broad range of interests and topics, including (but not limited to): authors past and present; music; storytelling; comics; bookshops; travel; fairy tales; America; inspiration; libraries; ghosts; and the title piece, at turns touching and self-deprecating, which recounts the author’s experiences at the 2010 Academy Awards in Hollywood. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insightful, incisive, witty, and wise, &lt;i&gt;The View from the Cheap Seats&lt;/i&gt; explores the issues and subjects that matter most to Neil Gaiman—offering a glimpse into the head and heart of one of the most acclaimed, beloved, and influential artists of our time.</description>

  <description>#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Laurie Notaro isn’t exactly a domestic goddess—unless that means she fully embraces her genetic hoarding predisposition, sneaks peeks at her husband’s daily journal, or has made a list of the people she wants on her Apocalypse Survival team (her husband’s not on it). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by Victorian household manuals, Notaro chronicles her chronic misfortune in the domestic arts, including cooking, cleaning, and putting on Spanx while sweaty (which should technically qualify as an Olympic sport). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Housebroken&lt;/i&gt; is a rollicking new collection of essays showcasing her irreverent wit and inability to feel shame. From defying nature in the quest to making her own Twinkies, to begging her new neighbors not to become urban livestock keepers, to teaching her eight-year-old nephew about hobos, Notaro recounts her best efforts—and hilarious failures—in keeping a household inches away from being condemned. After all, home wasn’t built in a day.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;As the daughter of a drug dealer, Wavy knows not to trust people, not even her own parents. It's safer to keep her mouth shut and stay out of sight. Struggling to raise her little brother, Donal, eight-year-old Wavy is the only responsible adult around. Obsessed with the constellations, she finds peace in the starry night sky above the fields behind her house, until one night her star gazing causes an accident. After witnessing his motorcycle wreck, she forms an unusual friendship with one of her father's thugs, Kellen, a tattooed ex-con with a heart of gold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time Wavy is a teenager, her relationship with Kellen is the only tender thing in a brutal world of addicts and debauchery. When tragedy rips Wavy's family apart, a well-meaning aunt steps in, and what is beautiful to Wavy looks ugly under the scrutiny of the outside world. Kellen may not be innocent, but he is the fixed point in Wavy and Donal's chaotic universe. Instead of playing it safe, Wavy has to learn to fight for Kellen, for her brother, and for herself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Life can be hard: your lover cheats on you; you lose a family member; you can’t pay the bills—and it can be great: you’ve had the hottest sex of your life; you get that plum job; you muster the courage to write your novel. Sugar—the once-anonymous online columnist at &lt;i&gt;The Rumpus, &lt;/i&gt;now revealed as Cheryl Strayed, author of the bestselling memoir &lt;i&gt;Wild&lt;/i&gt;—is the person thousands turn to for advice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tiny Beautiful Things&lt;/i&gt; brings the best of Dear Sugar in one place and includes never-before-published columns and a new introduction by Steve Almond.  Rich with humor, insight, compassion—and absolute honesty—this book&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;is a balm for everything life throws our way.</description>

  <description>From the author of the&lt;i&gt; New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;Eleanor &amp;amp; Park&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;A coming-of-age tale of fan fiction, family and first love.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cath is a Simon Snow fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, the whole world is a Simon Snow fan...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for Cath, being a fan is her life—and she’s really good at it. She and her twin sister, Wren, ensconced themselves in the Simon Snow series when they were just kids; it’s what got them through their mother leaving. Reading. Rereading. Hanging out in Simon Snow forums, writing Simon Snow fan fiction, dressing up like the characters for every movie premiere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cath’s sister has mostly grown away from fandom, but Cath can’t let go. She doesn’t want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that they’re going to college, Wren has told Cath she doesn’t want to be roommates. Cath is on her own, completely outside of her comfort zone. She’s got a surly roommate with a charming, always-around boyfriend, a fiction-writing professor who thinks fan fiction is the end of the civilized world, a handsome classmate who only wants to talk about words... And she can’t stop worrying about her dad, who’s loving and fragile and has never really been alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Cath, the question is: Can she do this? Can she make it without Wren holding her hand? Is she ready to start living her own life? Writing her own stories?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And does she even want to move on if it means leaving Simon Snow behind?</description>

  <description>Before Liz Lemon, before "Weekend Update," before "Sarah Palin," Tina Fey was just a young girl with a dream: a recurring stress dream that she was being chased through a local airport by her middle-school gym teacher. She also had a dream that one day she would be a comedian on TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has seen both these dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At last, Tina Fey's story can be told. From her youthful days as a vicious nerd to her tour of duty on &lt;i&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/i&gt;; from her passionately halfhearted pursuit of physical beauty to her life as a mother eating things off the floor; from her one-sided college romance to her nearly fatal honeymoon—from the beginning of this paragraph to this final sentence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tina Fey reveals all, and proves what we've all suspected: you're no one until someone calls you bossy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Includes Special, Never-Before-Solicited Opinions on Breastfeeding, Princesses, Photoshop, the Electoral Process, and Italian Rum Cake!)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;An unabridged recording on 5 CDs (5.5 Hours).&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;From the author of the beloved &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; bestselling book &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? &lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;and the creator and star of &lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;The Mindy Project&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;b&gt; comes a collection of essays that are as hilarious and insightful as they are deeply personal.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Why Not Me?, &lt;/i&gt; Kaling shares her ongoing journey to find contentment and excitement in her adult life, whether it's falling in love at work, seeking new friendships in lonely places, attempting to be the first person in history to lose weight without any behavior modification whatsoever, or most important, believing that you have a place in Hollywood when you're constantly reminded that no one looks like you. &lt;br /&gt; In "How to Look Spectacular: A Starlet's Confessions", Kaling gives her tongue-in-cheek secrets for surefire on-camera beauty, ("Your natural hair color may be appropriate for your skin tone, but this isn't the land of appropriate-&lt;i&gt;this is Hollywood, baby&lt;/i&gt;. Out here, a dark-skinned woman s traditional hair color is honey blonde.") "Player" tells the story of Kaling being seduced and dumped by a female friend in L.A. ("I had been replaced by a younger model. And now they had matching bangs.") In "Unlikely Leading Lady", she muses on America's fixation with the weight of actresses, ("Most women we see onscreen are either so thin that they're walking clavicles or so huge that their only scenes involve them breaking furniture.") And in "Soup Snakes", Kaling spills some secrets on her relationship with her ex-boyfriend and close friend, B.J. Novak ("I will freely admit: my relationship with B.J. Novak is weird as hell.") &lt;br /&gt; Mindy turns the anxieties, the glamour, and the celebrations of her second coming-of-age into a laugh-out-loud funny collection of essays that anyone who's ever been at a turning point in their life or career can relate to. And those who've never been at a turning point can skip to the parts where she talks about meeting Bradley Cooper.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of 13 Sherlock Holmes stories, originally published in 1903-1904, by Arthur Conan Doyle. This was the first Holmes collection since 1893, when Holmes had "died" in &lt;i&gt;The Final Problem&lt;/i&gt;. Having published &lt;i&gt;The Hound of the Baskervilles&lt;/i&gt; in 1901-1902 (although setting it before Holmes' death) Doyle came under intense pressure to revive his famous character. The first story is set in 1894 and has Holmes returning in London and explaining the period from 1891-94, a period called "The Great Hiatus" by Sherlockian enthusiasts. Also of note is Watson's statement in the last story of the cycle that Holmes has retired, and forbids him to publish any more stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contents&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "The Adventure of the Empty House"&lt;br /&gt; "The Adventure of the Norwood Builder"&lt;br /&gt; "The Adventure of the Dancing Men"&lt;br /&gt; "The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist"&lt;br /&gt; "The Adventure of the Priory School"&lt;br /&gt; "The Adventure of Black Peter"&lt;br /&gt; "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton"&lt;br /&gt; "The Adventure of the Six Napoleons"&lt;br /&gt; "The Adventure of the Three Students"&lt;br /&gt; "The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez"&lt;br /&gt; "The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter"&lt;br /&gt; "The Adventure of the Abbey Grange"&lt;br /&gt; "The Adventure of the Second Stain"</description>

The legend of the devil-beast that haunts the moors around the Baskerville family's home warns the descendants of that ancient clan never to venture out in those dark hours when the power of evil is exalted. Now, the most recent Baskerville, Sir Charles, is dead and the footprints of a giant hound have been found near his body. Will the new heir meet the same fate?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The story of an odd couple—a British military historian and the Tawny Owl with whom he lived for fifteen years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Martin Windrow was a war historian with little experience with pets when he adopted an owl the size of a corncob. Adorable but with knife-sharp talons, Mumble became Windrow’s closest, if at times unpredictable, companion, first in a South London flat and later in the more owl-friendly Sussex countryside. In &lt;i&gt;The Owl Who Liked Sitting on Caesar&lt;/i&gt;, Windrow recalls with wry humor their finer moments as well as the reactions of incredulous neighbors, the awkwardness of buying Mumble unskinned rabbit at Harrods Food Hall, and the grievous sense of loss when Mumble nearly escapes.&lt;br /&gt;     As Windrow writes: “Mumble was so much a part of my life in those days that the oddity of our relationship seldom occurred to me, and I only thought about it when faced with other people’s astonishment. When new acquaintances learned that they were talking to a book editor who shared a seventh-floor flat in a South London tower block with a Tawny Owl, some tended to edge away, rather thoughtfully . . . I tried to answer patiently, but I found it hard to come up with a short reply to the direct question ‘Yes, but . . . &lt;i&gt;why?&lt;/i&gt;’; my best answer was simply ‘Why not?’”&lt;br /&gt;     In the spirit of J. R. Ackerley’s &lt;i&gt;My Dog Tulip&lt;/i&gt;, Windrow offers a poignant and unforgettable reminiscence of his charmed years with his improbable pet, as well as an unexpected education in the paleontology, zoology, and sociology of owls.</description>

  <description>Have you ever wished you could live in an earlier, more romantic era? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, welcome to the 19th century, where there's arsenic in your face cream, a pot of cold pee sits under your bed, and all of your underwear is crotchless. (Why? Shush, dear. A lady doesn't question.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNMENTIONABLE is your hilarious, illustrated, scandalously honest (yet never crass) guide to the secrets of Victorian womanhood, giving you detailed advice on: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ What to wear &lt;br /&gt;~ Where to relieve yourself &lt;br /&gt;~ How to conceal your loathsome addiction to menstruating &lt;br /&gt;~ What to expect on your wedding night &lt;br /&gt;~ How to be the perfect Victorian wife &lt;br /&gt;~ Why masturbating will kill you &lt;br /&gt;~ And more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irresistibly charming, laugh-out-loud funny, and featuring nearly 200 images from Victorian publications, UNMENTIONABLE will inspire a whole new level of respect for Elizabeth Bennett, Scarlet O'Hara, Jane Eyre, and all of our great, great grandmothers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(And it just might leave you feeling ecstatically&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;grateful to live in an age of pants, super absorbency tampons, epidurals, anti-depressants, and not-dying-of-the-syphilis-your-husband-brought-home.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Comedian, activist, and hugely popular culture blogger at AwesomelyLuvvie.com, Luvvie Ajayi, serves up necessary advice for the common senseless in this hilarious book of essays&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With over 500,000 readers a month at her enormously popular blog, AwesomelyLuvvie.com, Luvvie Ajayi has become a go-to source for smart takes on pop culture. &lt;i&gt;I'm Judging You&lt;/i&gt; is her debut book of humorous essays that dissects our cultural obsessions and calls out bad behavior in our increasingly digital, connected lives—from the cultural importance of the newest Shonda Rhimes television drama to serious discussions of race and media representation to what to do about your fool cousin sharing casket pictures from Grandma's wake on Facebook. With a lighthearted, rapier wit and a unique perspective, &lt;i&gt;I'm Judging You&lt;/i&gt; is the handbook the world needs, doling out the hard truths and a road map for bringing some "act right" into our lives, social media, and popular culture.</description>

  <description>If you graduated from college but still feel like a student . . . if you wear a business suit to job interviews but pajamas to the grocery store . . . if you have your own apartment but no idea how to cook or clean . . . it's OK. But it doesn't have to be this way.&lt;br /&gt;Just because you don't feel like an adult doesn't mean you can't act like one. And it all begins with this funny, wise, and useful book.

  <description>A sharp, funny, delightfully unhinged collection of stories set in the dark world of domesticity, "American Housewife "features murderous ladies who lunch, celebrity treasure hunters, and the best bra fitter south of the Mason Dixon line. &lt;br /&gt;Meet the women of "American Housewife: " they wear lipstick, pearls, and sunscreen, even when it's cloudy. They casserole. They pinwheel. They pump the salad spinner like it's a CPR dummy. And then they kill a party crasher, carefully stepping around the body to pull cookies out of the oven. These twelve irresistible stories take us from a haunted prewar Manhattan apartment building to the set of a rigged reality television show, from the unique initiation ritual of a book club to the getaway car of a pageant princess on the lam, from the gallery opening of a tinfoil artist to the fitting room of a legendary lingerie shop. Vicious, fresh, and nutty as a poisoned Goo Goo Cluster, "American Housewife" is an uproarious, pointed commentary on womanhood.</description>

  <description>For anyone looking to declutter, organize, and simplify, author Erin Boyle shares practical guidance and personal insights on small-space living and conscious consumption. At once pragmatic and philosophical, &lt;i&gt;Simple Matters&lt;/i&gt; is a nod to the growing consensus that living simply and purposefully is more sustainable not only for the environment, but for our own happiness and well-being, too. Boyle embraces the notion that “living small” is beneficial and accessible to us all—whether we’re renting a tiny apartment or purchasing a three-story house.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Filled with personal essays, projects, and helpful advice on how to be inventive and resourceful in a tight space, &lt;i&gt;Simple Matters&lt;/i&gt; shows that living simply is about making do with less and ending up with more: more free time, more time with loved ones, more savings, and more things of beauty.</description>

  <description>Mindy Kaling has lived many lives: the obedient child of immigrant professionals, a timid chubster afraid of her own bike, a Ben Affleck–impersonating Off-Broadway performer and playwright, and, finally, a comedy writer and actress prone to starting fights with her friends and coworkers with the sentence “Can I just say one last thing about this, and then I swear I’ll shut up about it?” &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Perhaps you want to know what Mindy thinks makes a great best friend (someone who will fill your prescription in the middle of the night), or what makes a great guy (one who is aware of all elderly people in any room at any time and acts accordingly), or what is the perfect amount of fame (so famous you can never get convicted of murder in a court of law), or how to maintain a trim figure (you will not find that information in these pages). If so, you’ve come to the right book, mostly!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, &lt;/i&gt;Mindy invites readers on a tour of her life and her unscientific observations on romance, friendship, and Hollywood, with several conveniently placed stopping points for you to run errands and make phone calls. Mindy Kaling really is just a Girl Next Door—not so much literally anywhere in the continental United States, but definitely if you live in India or Sri Lanka.</description>

  <description>It all starts on the one-hundredth birthday of Allan Karlsson. Sitting quietly in his room in an old people’s home, he is waiting for the party he-never-wanted-anyway to begin. The Mayor is going to be there. The press is going to be there. But, as it turns out, Allan is not… Slowly but surely Allan climbs out of his bedroom window, into the flowerbed (in his slippers) and makes his getaway. And so begins his picaresque and unlikely journey involving criminals, several murders, a suitcase full of cash, and incompetent police. As his escapades unfold, we learn something of Allan’s earlier life in which – remarkably – he helped to make the atom bomb, became friends with American presidents, Russian tyrants, and Chinese leaders, and was a participant behind the scenes in many key events of the twentieth century. Already a huge bestseller across Europe, &lt;i&gt;The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared&lt;/i&gt; is a fun and feel-good book for all ages.</description>

  <description>The official novelization of the eagerly anticipated blockbuster film, written and directed by David Ayer ("Fury," "End of Watch") and based on DC Comics'"Suicide Squad."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;It feels good to be bad...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assemble a team of the world's most dangerous, incarcerated Super Villains, provide them with the most powerful arsenal at the government's disposal, and send them off on a mission to defeat an enigmatic, insuperable entity. U.S intelligence officer Amanda Waller has determined only a secretly convened group of disparate, despicable individuals with next to nothing to lose will do. However, once they realize they weren't picked to succeed but chosen for their patent culpability when they inevitably fail, will the Suicide Squad resolve to die trying, or decide it's every man for himself?</description>

  <description>The trend in superheroes of the late 1980s was dark, grim, gritty, and not very kid friendly. Then along came the animated Batman series. The visual style was totally unique: clean, sharp, and bold. &lt;i&gt;Batman Adventures: Mad Love&lt;/i&gt; is an original comics story drawn in the style of the popular animated series. It's even put together by Paul Dini, a major force behind the animated show. This particular story involves Batman's old foe, the Joker, and Joker's cute but deadly sidekick, Harley Quinn. Actor Mark Hamill of &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; fame, who plays the voice of the Joker in the animated series, claims that this is one of his all-time favorite comics, calling it "bold, lusty, gleefully demented."</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Two great spiritual masters share their own hard-won wisdom about living with joy even in the face of adversity.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The occasion was a big birthday. And it inspired two close friends to get together in Dharamsala for a talk about something very important to them. The friends were His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The subject was joy. Both winners of the Nobel Prize, both great spiritual masters and moral leaders of our time, they are also known for being among the most infectiously happy people on the planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the beginning the book was envisioned as a three-layer birthday cake: their own stories and teachings about joy, the most recent findings in the science of deep happiness, and the daily practices that anchor their own emotional and spiritual lives. Both the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Tutu have been tested by great personal and national adversity, and here they share their personal stories of struggle and renewal. Now that they are both in their eighties, they especially want to spread the core message that to have joy yourself, you must bring joy to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of all, during that landmark week in Dharamsala, they demonstrated by their own exuberance, compassion, and humor how joy can be transformed from a fleeting emotion into an enduring way of life.</description>

  <description>The anti-clutter movement is having a moment. You may have heard about a book—an entire book—written on the topic of tidiness and how “magical” and “life-changing” it is to neaten up and THROW AWAY YOUR BELONGINGS. Yes, you read that correctly. It’s time to fight that ridiculousness and start buying even more stuff and leaving it any place you want. Guess what, neatniks? Science shows that messy people are more creative.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a slob is an art, and there’s a fine line between being a consumer and being a hoarder. Don’t cross that line. This book shows you how to clutter mindfully and with great joy. The results are mind-blowing. Your plants will stop dying. Your whiskey bottle will never run dry. Your drugstore points will finally add up to a free jar of salsa and some nice shampoo. You’ll go shopping and discover you’ve lost weight...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's time to take back your life from the anti-clutter movement.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*As well as smarter and more attractive.</description>

  <description>The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes are overshadowed by the event with which they close - the meeting of the great detective and Moriarty, the Napoleon of Crime. Their struggle, seemingly to the death, was to leave many readers desolate at the loss of Holmes, but was also to lead to his immortality as a literary figure.</description>

  <description>I should have asked the question "How could someone who was missing be in two places at once?" Instead, I asked the wrong question -- four wrong questions, more or less. This is the account of the second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the fading town of Stain'd-by-the-Sea, young apprentice Lemony Snicket has a new case to solve when he and his chaperone are hired to find a missing girl. Is the girl a runaway? Or was she kidnapped? Was she seen last at the grocery store? Or could she have stopped at the diner? Is it really any of your business? These are All The Wrong Questions.</description>

  <description>The adventure began in a fading town. Far from anyone he knew or trusted, a young Lemony Snicket started an apprenticeship for a secret organization shrouded in mystery and secrecy. He asked questions that shouldn't have been on his mind. Now he has written an account that should not be published that shouldn't be read. Not even by you. Seriously, we recommend that you do NOT ask your parents for this, the first book in his new ALL THE WRONG QUESTIONS series.&lt;br /&gt;Lemony Snicket, in case you don't already know, grew up to be the author of A Series of Unfortunate Events series.</description>

  <description>Complete in nine handsome volumes, each with an introduction by a Doyle scholar, a chronology, a selected bibliography, and explanatory notes, the Oxford Sherlock Holmes series offers a definitive collection of the famous detective's adventures. No home library is complete without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comprising the series of short stories that made the fortunes of the Strand, the magazine in which they were first published, this volume won even more popularity for Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Holmes is at the height of his powers in many of his most famous cases, including &lt;i&gt;The Red-Headed League&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Speckled Band&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Blue Carbuncle&lt;/i&gt;.</description>

  <description>Ripped apart by Portugal’s financial crisis, Daniel’s family is struggling to adjust to circumstances beyond their control. His wife and children move out to live with family hours away, but Daniel believes against all odds that he will find a job and everything will return to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even as he loses his home, suffers severe damage to his car, and finds himself living in his old, abandoned office building, Daniel fights the realization that things have changed. He’s unable to see what remains among the rubble—friendship, his family’s love, and people’s deep desire to connect. If Daniel can let go of the past and find his true self, he just might save not only himself but also everyone that really matters to him.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get on the path to better health, effortless weight loss, and incredible improvements in sleep quality, energy, and mood with THE WHOLE30.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melissa and Dallas Hartwig are the authors of &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller IT STARTS WITH FOOD, which has taken America by storm, and the founders of the Whole9, an online community focused on health, fitness, and sanity serving 1.5 million visitors a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their new book THE WHOLE30 provides all the resources you need to reset your health. Based on Paleo diet principles, this is not a traditional diet book but a way to implement lasting change in your life by eating real food for 30 days. By following the WHOLE30 programme, the authors argue that you can reclaim your health and transform your relationship with food in the long term. The authors' positive empowering message and the health benefits and weight loss this programme can bring make this book potentially life changing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Motivating and inspiring with just the right amount of Dallas' and Melissa's signature tough love, THE WHOLE30 features real-life success stories, answers to common questions, detailed elimination and reintroduction guidelines, and more than 100 recipes using familiar ingredients, from simple one-pot meals to complete dinner party menus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  &lt;i&gt;Dear Reader,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have just picked up this book, then it is not too late to put it back down. Like the previous books in A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS, there is nothing to be found in these pages but misery, despair, and discomfort, and you still have time to choose something else to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the chapters of this story, Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire encounter a darkened staircase, a red herring, some friends in a dire situation, three mysterious initials, a liar with an evil scheme, a secret passageway, and parsley soda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have sworn to write down these tales of the Baudelaire orphans so the general public will know each terrible thing that has happened to them, but if you decide to read something else instead, you will save yourself from a heapful of horror and woe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;With all due respect,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lemony Snicket&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are at first optimistic--attending school is a welcome change for the book-loving trio, and the academy is allegedly safe from the dreaded Count Olaf, who is after their fortune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Reader, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a story about cheerful youngsters spending a jolly time at boarding school, look elsewhere. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire arc intelligent and resourceful children, and you might expect that they would do very well at school. Don't. For the Baudelaires, school turns out to be another miserable episode in their unlucky lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truth be told, within the chapters that make up this dreadful story, the children will face snapping crabs, strict punishments, dripping fungus, comprehensive exams, violin recitals, S.O.R.E., and the metric system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my solemn duty to stay up all night researching and writing the history of these three hapless youngsters, but you may be more comfortable getting a good night's sleep. In that case, you should probably choose some other book. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all due respect,&lt;br /&gt;Lemony Snicket</description>

  <description>Dear Reader,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope, for your sake, that you have not chosen to read this book because you are in the mood for a pleasant experience. If this is the case, I advise you to put this book down instantaneously, because of all the books describing the unhappy lives of the Baudelaire orphans, The Miserable Mill might be the unhappiest yet. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are sent to Paltryville to work in a lumber mill, and they find disaster and misfortune lurking behind every log.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pages of this book, I'm sorry to inform you, contain such unpleasantries as a giant pincher machine, a bad casserole, a man with a cloud of smoke where his head should be, a hypnotist, a terrible accident resulting in injury, and coupons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have promised to write down the entire history of these three poor children, but you haven't, so if you prefer stories that are more heartwarming, please feel free to make another selection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all due respect,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lemony Snicket</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;It's a love story gone horribly, horribly wrong as the Joker's partner in crime takes the spotlight in this lushly illustrated hardcover volume featuring art by Terry Dodson and Rachel Dodson (WONDER WOMAN). There's never a dull moment as Harley bounces from botched schemes to close encounters with Gotham City's kingpins of crime, all the while making wisecracks and acting in the spirit of inspired lunacy. &lt;br /&gt;This volume includes appearances by Batman, Two-Face, Catwoman, Poison Ivy, the Penguin and more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Readers of all ages will welcome the chance to be reunited with Dorothy Gale and such beloved characters as the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Cowardly Lion, as well as to meet new favorites such as the Hungry Tiger, whose appetite is &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; satisfied; Princess Langwidere, who has thirty heads; Billina, a talking chicken; and Tiktok, a mechanical man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blown overboard while sailing with her uncle, Dorothy finds herself in the fairy realm of Ev. She sets out with her friends to rescue the Queen of Ev and her ten children, who have been imprisoned by the cruel Nome King. But even Ozma, the wise Ruler of Oz, is no match for the clever king, and it's up to Dorothy to save everyone from terrible danger. But will the Nome King's enchantments be too much even for the plucky little girl from Kansas?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I enjoyed this one quite a bit!!!<br /><br />The only real issue I had was: Why the heck does Dorothy have an accent now? It was distracting and she didn't have it before...other than that though, great read!<br /><br />Read about other boo...]]>

  <description>Tip builds a pumpkinheaded man as a joke. But the joke's on Tip when a mean old witch brings Jack Pumpkinhead to life! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon Jack and Tip-and their friend, the Sawhorse-are on the road to Oz. There they join forces with the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman against the rebel army of General Jinjur, who has conquered the Emerald City. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Tip and his friends defeat Jinjur, they can restore the throne to the rightful ruler-Princess Ozma. There's just one slight problem-they've got to find the princes first.</description>

  <description>Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh, bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Peace is Every Step&lt;/em&gt; and one of the most respected and celebrated religious leaders in the world, delivers a powerful path to happiness through mastering life's most important skill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do we say what we mean in a way that the other person can really hear?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can we listen with compassion and understanding?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Communication fuels the ties that bind, whether in relationships, business, or everyday interactions. Most of us, however, have never been taught the fundamental skills of communication—or how to best represent our true selves. Effective communication is as important to our well-being and happiness as the food we put into our bodies. It can be either healthy (and nourishing) or toxic (and destructive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this precise and practical guide, Zen master and Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh reveals how to listen mindfully and express your fullest and most authentic self. With examples from his work with couples, families, and international conflicts, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating&lt;/em&gt; helps us move beyond the perils and frustrations of misrepresentation and misunderstanding to learn the listening and speaking skills that will forever change how we experience and impact the world.</description>

  <description>"If any individual is compassionate and altruistic, wherever that person moves, he or she will immediately make friends."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gorgeous book by the Dalai Lama brings together profound, accessible teachings by His Holiness on living a joyful life with extraordinary images that offer insight into the rich cultural heritage of Tibetan Buddhism. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn how to live peacefully with all people and with our planet. Master the skills to deal with anger and negative emotions. Cultivate techniques to nurture open-heartedness and compassion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photographer Ian Cumming's images of landscapes, monasteries, and Tibetan people, both the monastic community and lay practitioners, take the reader on a spectacular photographic journey into the heart of Buddhist practice. These photographs help us to deepen our appreciation of the context in which Tibetan Buddhism developed and to see how it is now practiced by those in Tibet as well as those in exile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ian Cumming is a travel photographer specializing in Tibet and the Caribbean and is the leading photographer with the London-based agency Tibet Images. His photographs appear in &lt;i&gt;A Simple Path&lt;/i&gt;, another book by His Holiness.</description>

In &lt;i&gt;How to Get Dressed&lt;/i&gt;, Alison distills her secrets into a fun, comprehensive style guide focused on rethinking your wardrobe like a fashion expert and making what’s in your closet work for you. She provides real-world advice about everything style-related, including: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Making every garment you own fit better&lt;br /&gt;• Mastering closet organization&lt;br /&gt;• The undergarments you actually need&lt;br /&gt;• The scoop on tailors and which alterations are worth it&lt;br /&gt;• Shopping thrift and vintage like a rockstar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of repeating boring style “rules,” Alison breaks the rules and gets real about everything from bras to how to deal with inevitable fashion disasters. Including helpful information such as how to skip ironing and the dry cleaners, remove every stain under the sun, and help clueless men get their sartorial acts together, &lt;i&gt;How to Get Dressed&lt;/i&gt; has hundreds of insider tips from Alison’s arsenal of tools and expertise.</description>

  <description>This is a book I wrote. Because I wrote it, I had to figure out what to put on the back cover to explain what it is. I tried to write a long, third-person summary that would imply how great the book is and also sound vaguely authoritative--like maybe someone who isn’t me wrote it--but I soon discovered that I’m not sneaky enough to pull it off convincingly. So I decided to just make a list of things that are in the book:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pictures&lt;br /&gt;Words&lt;br /&gt;Stories about things that happened to me&lt;br /&gt;Stories about things that happened to other people because of me&lt;br /&gt;Eight billion dollars*&lt;br /&gt;Stories about dogs&lt;br /&gt;The secret to eternal happiness*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*These are lies. Perhaps I have underestimated my sneakiness!</description>

  <description>Expert muffin baker Merry Wynter is finally ready to turn her passion into a career. But when a dead body is found on her property, she’s more worried about cooking up an alibi…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merry is making a fresh start in small-town Autumn Vale, New York, in the mansion she’s inherited from her late uncle, Melvin. The house is run-down and someone has been digging giant holes on the grounds, but with its restaurant-quality kitchen, the place has potential for her new baking business. She even has her first client—the local retirement home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Merry soon finds that quite a few townsfolk didn’t like Uncle Mel, and she has inherited their enmity as well as his home. Local baker Binny Turner and her crazy brother, Tom, blame Melvin for their father’s death, and Tom may be the one vandalizing her land. But when Tom turns up dead in one of the holes in her yard, Merry needs to prove she had nothing to do with his death—or her new muffin-making career may crumble before it starts...</description>

  <description>A one-stop-read for those seeking a comprehensive introductory guide to sustainable living... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will getting your dream job, buying your dream car, living in your dream home, and going on your dream vacation enable you to live happily ever after? Will eating balanced diets, exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep be sufficient for long-term health? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to what you might think, the answers are no and no. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why? Because happiness is not something you can conquer in the outside world, but an ongoing, positive state of mind that must first be cultivated within you. And total wellness requires us to take care of not only ourselves, but also the planet that we all call home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through the use of research-based evidence, easy-to-do exercises, and suggestions for how the reader can participate in creating sustainability in all areas of life, Thrive shows you how to build psychological riches, boost your holistic physical well-being, make informed and sustainable food choices, shop for nontoxic, eco-conscious daily consumer products, and travel in ways that will not only transform you, but even the communities that you touch upon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you ready to begin living toward true personal wellness and world sustainability?</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;From the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the Sookie Stackhouse novels—“the Mark Twain of things that live under your bed”*—comes a new novel of Midnight, Texas, the town where some secrets will never see the light of day...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Midnight’s local pawnshop, weapons are flying off the shelves—only to be used in sudden and dramatic suicides right at the main crossroads in town. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Who better to figure out why blood is being spilled than the vampire Lemuel, who, while translating mysterious texts, discovers what makes Midnight the town it is. There’s a reason why witches and werewolves, killers and psychics, have been drawn to this place. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; And now they must come together to stop the bloodshed in the heart of Midnight. For if all hell breaks loose—which just might happen—it will put the secretive town on the map, where no one wants it to be...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; *&lt;i&gt;Houston Press&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Watson and Holmes: A match made in disaster.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamie Watson and Charlotte Holmes are looking for a winter-break reprieve after a fall semester that almost got them killed. But Charlotte isn’t the only Holmes with secrets, and the mood at her family’s Sussex estate is palpably tense. On top of everything else, Holmes and Watson could be becoming &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; than friends—but still, the darkness in Charlotte’s past is a wall between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A distraction arises soon enough, because Charlotte’s beloved uncle Leander goes missing from the estate—after being oddly private about his latest assignment in a German art forgery ring. The game is afoot once again, and Charlotte is single-minded in her pursuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their first stop? Berlin. Their first contact? August Moriarty (formerly Charlotte’s obsession, currently believed by most to be dead), whose powerful family has been ripping off famous paintings for the last hundred years. But as they follow the gritty underground scene in Berlin to glittering art houses in Prague, Holmes and Watson begin to realize that this is a much more complicated case than a disappearance. Much more dangerous, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What they learn might change everything they know about their families, themselves, and each other.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Wylie Dalton didn’t believe in fairy tales or love at first sight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she met a real-life Peter Pan.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Wylie encounters Phinn—confident, mature, and devastatingly handsome—at a party the night before her brother goes to juvie, she can’t believe how fast she falls for him. And that’s before he shows her how to fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon Wylie and her brothers find themselves whisked away to a mysterious tropical island off the coast of New York City where nobody ages beyond seventeen and life is a constant party. Wylie’s in heaven: now her brother won’t go to jail and she can escape her over-scheduled life with all its woes and responsibilities—permanently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the deeper Wylie falls for Phinn, the more she begins to discover has been kept from her and her brothers. Somebody on the island has been lying to her, but the truth can’t stay hidden forever.</description>

  <description>Made in America. Outsourced to India. At Home with Herself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A charming yet honest memoir of one Upper West side housewife who finds herself saying good-bye to Starbucks and all her notions of "home" when she and her husband are outsourced to Hyderabad. Jenny Feldon imagined life in India as a glitzy yoga whirlwind. Instead she found buffalo-related traffic jams. Jenny struggled to fight the depression, bitterness, and anger as her sense of self and her marriage began to unravel. And it was all India's fault--wasn't it? Equally frustrating, revealing, and amusing, this is the true story of an accidental housewife trapped in the third world.</description>

  <description>Subtitle: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail. The Appalachian Trail stretches from Georgia to Maine and covers some of the most breathtaking terrain in America–majestic mountains, silent forests, sparking lakes. If you’re going to take a hike, it’s probably the place to go. And Bill Bryson is surely the most entertaining guide you’ll find. He introduces us to the history and ecology of the trail and to some of the other hardy (or just foolhardy) folks he meets along the way–and a couple of bears. Already a classic, &lt;i&gt;A Walk in the Woods &lt;/i&gt; will make you long for the great outdoors (or at least a comfortable chair to sit and read in).</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;"While Tolliver slept, I wondered if it was possible that Cameron was still alive...At first, I'd thought she'd been abducted by a gang, sold into slavery, something lurid and horrible. Then I'd wondered if maybe she'd simply been fed up with her life: the tawdry parents and the tacky trailer, the sister who limped and looked abstracted, the baby sisters who never seemed to stay clean. Most days, though, I was sure she was dead."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lightning-struck sleuth Harper Connelly and her stepbrother Tolliver take a break from looking for the dead to visit the two little girls they both think of as sisters. But, as always happens when they travel to Texas, memories of their horrible childhood resurface...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make matter worse, Tolliver learns from his older brother that their father is out of jail and trying to reestablish contact with other family members. Tolliver wants nothing to do with the man - but he may not have a say in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, family secrets ensnare them both, as Harper finally discovers what happened to her missing sister, Cameron, so may years before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what she finds out will change her world forever...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Tied things up well. The pacing was decent. Harris still OVERUSES THE WORD LITTLE and it frickin drives me crazy. It is a bad writing habit that her editors just never seem to catch and correct. It always distracts from the story. :( <br /><br />Regardless I think she left a thread open at the end on them no...]]>

  <description>Hired to find a boy gene missing in Doraville, North Carolina, Harper Connelly and her brother Tolliver head there, only to discover that the boy was the only one left of several who had disappeared over the previous five years. All of them teenagers. All unlikely runaways. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; All calling for Harper. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Harper soon finds them—eight victims, buried in the half-frozen ground, all come to an unspeakable end. Afterward, what she most wants to do is collect her fee and get out of town ahead of the media storm that's soon to descend. But when she's attacked and prevented from leaving, she reluctantly becomes a part of the investigation as she learns more than she cares to about the dark mysteries and long-hidden secrets of Doraville—knowledge that makes her the next person likely to rest in an ice-cold grave.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;When I was fifteen, I was struck by a bolt of lightning through an open window of the trailer where we lived...I recovered, mostly. I have a strange spiderweb pattern of red on my torso and right leg, which has episodes of weakness. Sometimes my right hand shakes. I have headaches. I have many fears. And I can find dead people. That was the part that interested the professor...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the request of anthropology professor Dr. Clyde Nunley, Harper Connelly and her stepbrother Tolliver come to Memphis to give a demonstration of Harper's unique talent. And what better place to have that demonstration than in a very old cemetery?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nunley doesn't bother to hide his skepticism, especially when Harper stands atop a grave and senses &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; bodies beneath her - one of a centuries-dead man and the other of a young girl, recently deceased. When the grave is opened, Harper's claim is proven true. The dead girl is Tabitha Morgenstern, an eleven-year-old abducted from Nashville two years previously - a child whom Harper had tried, and failed, to find. The coincidence raises suspicions about her among the police - so she and Tolliver undertake their own hunt to find the killer. They make a nocturnal visit to the cemetery, hoping that Harper can sense something further about the murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, the next morning, a third dead body is found in the grave...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>After a price-fixing scandal at her prestigious New York auction house, Josie Prescott moves to the New Hampshire coast to restore her reputation--and perhaps a few antiques along the way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an antiques dealer, Josie knows how to make an honest assessment, and she's about to land her largest account. But when the owner of the collection is found stabbed to death, Josie's fingerprints are all over his possessions…and the murder weapon. Suddenly Josie's innocence appears as tarnished as an old relic. Everybody's got their eyes on her, especially the local police chief who may or may not be in love with her. Now it's just a matter of time before Josie can produce enough evidence to clear her name--or fall into the clutches of the real killer and find herself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;CONSIGNED TO DEATH&lt;/i&gt;

  <description>&lt;b&gt;One of America’s most original comedic voices delivers a darkly funny, wryly observed, and emotionally raw account of her year of death, cancer, and epiphany.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the span of four months in 2012, Tig Notaro was hospitalized for a debilitating intestinal disease called C.Diff, her mother unexpectedly died, she went through a breakup, and was diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer. Hit with this devastating barrage, Tig took her grief onstage. Days after receiving her cancer diagnosis, she broke new comedic ground, opening an unvarnished set with the words, “Good evening. Hello. I have cancer. How are you? Hi, how are you? Is everybody having a good time? I have cancer.” Word of the set went viral instantly. This set was ultimately released as Tig’s sophomore album, Live, which sold 100,000 units in just six weeks and was nominated for a Grammy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the wildly popular star takes stock of that no good, very bad year—a difficult yet astonishing period in which tragedy turned into absurdity and despair into joy. An inspired combination of the deadpan silliness of her comedy and the open-hearted vulnerability that has emerged in the wake of that dire time, Untitled is a moving and often hilarious look at this very brave, very funny woman’s journey through the darkness and her thrilling return.</description>
